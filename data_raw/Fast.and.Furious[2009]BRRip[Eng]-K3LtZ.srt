1
00:00:57,089 --> 00:00:59,387
All right, we're good to go.

2
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:02,256
You got this?
You bet your ass, bubba.

3
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:04,763
Let's make some money!

4
00:01:10,836 --> 00:01:12,133
Everyone in position.

5
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,806
I thought we'd be
robbing banks by now,

6
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,275
not some gas truck
in the middle of nowhere.

7
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:22,007
Down here, gas is gold, bubba.

8
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,782
Kill the chatter! Game time.

9
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:35,190
I wouldn't piss him off, guys.

10
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:58,115
Okay, guys, we're gonna
have to hit this hard and fast.

11
00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:01,016
We got 4K left
before the downgrade.

12
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:23,937
Locked and loaded!

13
00:02:49,768 --> 00:02:51,861
This is all you, Han.

14
00:02:57,276 --> 00:02:58,937
Liquid gold.

15
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,275
We're clear.

16
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:08,512
Okay, T, you're up.

17
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:15,617
Let's see if you can get it under
6 tries this time, huh, T?

18
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,994
It's more like 3.
Come on, Tego, keep it real.

19
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:42,178
Just one K left. We're running
out of road. Get in there, brother.

20
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:44,085
I got it, I got it.

21
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:54,525
Shit!

22
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:02,633
T, cut loose! Unhitch, unhitch!

23
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:51,922
Spray that hitch!
I don't have a hammer!

24
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,480
Just do it!

25
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:09,504
Hold on! Hold on!

26
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,065
No shit!

27
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:15,439
Hold onto something tight!

28
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,603
Letty!

29
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:42,936
Give me your hand!
I can't reach!

30
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,703
You got to jump!

31
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:12,096
Jump!

32
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:15,095
Letty, jump!

33
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:21,235
I've got you!

34
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:55,641
Dom...

35
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,176
Dom?

36
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:04,448
Dom!

37
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:16,785
How you doing?

38
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:20,055
Money, money!

39
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,560
Good.

40
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:27,103
Yo, why your stack
is bigger than mine always?

41
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:29,037
I'm supersized, baby.

42
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,648
Cops just raided our garage in Baracoa.

43
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:44,979
They were real interested in you.

44
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:50,357
Heat's on and we just sent up a flare
that's gonna lead them right to us.

45
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:53,489
I say we move out first thing
in the morning.

46
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,925
Nah, it's me they want.

47
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:59,537
And if they catch me,

48
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:02,596
they're throwing big numbers
at anybody with me.

49
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:07,745
Han, we had a good run.

50
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:12,478
Time for you to go
do your own thing.

51
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:19,414
Heard they're doing
some crazy shit in Tokyo.

52
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:27,631
Have you seen Letty?

53
00:09:40,178 --> 00:09:42,009
There she is.

54
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:50,715
I hear Rio is nice this time of year.

55
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:56,657
The cops are getting hungrier.

56
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:59,162
Then I guess we're doing our job.

57
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:05,870
I'm a walking target.

58
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:09,736
I don't want you around
when they catch up to me.

59
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,343
"Ride or die," remember?

60
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:18,445
Dom, how long have we
been doing this?

61
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,285
And now all of a sudden, out of
nowhere, it's too dangerous?

62
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,480
Come on.

63
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:34,557
We'll figure it out. We always do.

64
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,799
I don't know shit!
Give me a name!

65
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:04,967
I don't know shit, man!
Give me a name!

66
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:08,035
David Park! David Park's
the guy you want!

67
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:09,739
Please!

68
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:20,755
Thank God. Listen, he's in a mood
because yesterday was his cheat day,

69
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,793
and then today, some genius
brought in donuts.

70
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:24,089
Great.

71
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:27,023
Sorry I'm late.

72
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:32,667
Complaints keep rolling in after your
little downtown Olympics, O'Conner.

73
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:35,900
Tell me that reinstating you
wasn't a mistake.

74
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:39,171
I got a name. David Park.
That's it?

75
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:41,712
That's all you got?
David Park?

76
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,681
I could throw a fortune cookie out this window
and hit 50 David Parks right now.

77
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:47,411
It's Korean, not Chinese.
Whatever.

78
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:52,648
Park is a scout that recruits street racers
to be mules for the Braga cartel.

79
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:55,318
We find Park, and we bust
the bad guys.

80
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:21,649
Dom.

81
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:24,381
Mia, I told you not to call me here.

82
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:26,584
Dom, it's Letty.

83
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,390
She's been murdered.

84
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:49,570
We have gathered here
to pay our final respects to...

85
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:52,810
Let us reflect on her journey...

86
00:15:56,554 --> 00:16:01,253
"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
He makes me lie down... "

87
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:23,910
Facial recognition software
matched Toretto

88
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,813
about 10 minutes after
he crossed the border.

89
00:16:28,786 --> 00:16:30,413
I don't get it.

90
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,522
I thought he'd show.

91
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:30,076
I told you not to come.
They're staking the place out.

92
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:32,616
If they find you...
They won't.

93
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:38,616
Come on. Look at you.

94
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:07,350
Letty wouldn't let them junk it.

95
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,511
Even though it is a goddamn curse.

96
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:17,260
When she came back,
she was always in here,

97
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:20,787
working on it day and night.

98
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:28,064
It was weird.

99
00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:32,676
It was like she knew
you were coming back.

100
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:37,044
I want to see the crash site.

101
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:46,111
I just got off the phone
with Deputy Director Lawson.

102
00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:50,260
If we don't make serious inroads into
the Braga case in the next 72 hours,

103
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:52,592
they're gonna shut us down.

104
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,325
I know I'm a newbie here,
but why the clock now?

105
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,198
Because it's been 2 years,

106
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:00,794
and the last 3 agents we sent
to infiltrate his organization

107
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:03,238
came back in body bags.

108
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:07,903
He's moved more heroin across the border
than Escobar did in 10 years.

109
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:10,777
This guy is becoming one of
our biggest national threats,

110
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:12,941
and we don't even have
a picture of him.

111
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:16,544
We don't have prints!
Not even a goddamn DOB!

112
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,785
What's the status
on David Park?

113
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:24,089
Isn't he our ticket into
the Braga organization?

114
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:27,962
We're running the name through city and
county databases, sorting the possibilities.

115
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:29,966
We've got over 500 already.

116
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:33,094
Park's insignificant.
Sounds like another jerk-off to me.

117
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:37,164
It's not. Without Park, Braga wouldn't
have drivers to move his shipments.

118
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:40,005
Cross-check traffic.
Illegal modifications.

119
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:44,412
Street racing. This guy will definitely
have a record. We'll find him.

120
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:46,682
We better.

121
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:49,048
What do you know?

122
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,783
Your boy Toretto's red Chevelle has
been spotted in his old neighborhood.

123
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:54,688
I'm going to bring his ass in.

124
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:56,989
Not in your car you're not.

125
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:07,636
It's straight ahead.

126
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:15,729
You found something back there.

127
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:23,232
There were burn marks on the ground.

128
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:29,541
The kind that could only be
caused by nitrometh.

129
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:36,584
There's only one guy in all of L.A.
that sells that.

130
00:22:40,591 --> 00:22:43,788
Nothing you can do is gonna
bring her back, Dom.

131
00:22:45,863 --> 00:22:48,195
If I were Letty, I would ask you...

132
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,827
No, I would beg you,
please, let this go.

133
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:55,062
Before it's too late.

134
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:01,511
It's already too late.

135
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:08,483
I love you.

136
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,943
Miss Toretto.

137
00:24:17,888 --> 00:24:20,220
I'm Michael Stasiak, FBI.

138
00:24:20,758 --> 00:24:23,318
Let's you and I have a little chat.

139
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:47,716
Hi. This is Forsythe in Evidence.

140
00:24:47,785 --> 00:24:51,414
I need Stasiak down here right away
to sign some greenies.

141
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,013
Thanks.

142
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,648
Hi.
Hey.

143
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:57,285
Okay, I narrowed it down
to 50 or so David Parks.

144
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:59,761
What I'd like you to do is run the make
and model on each one of them.

145
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,819
All right?
Okay. All right.

146
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:02,126
Thank you.

147
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:15,075
Hey, Tyler, we got a transfer.

148
00:25:17,248 --> 00:25:19,273
You want to come with me?

149
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:41,966
Toretto.

150
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:44,831
When'd you get back in town?

151
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:47,810
I'm looking for a car
you did an engine mod on.

152
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:52,372
Nitromethane tank. Ford full-size.
Continental tires.

153
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:57,651
Look, what are you doing,
coming in here like this, huh?

154
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,851
This ain't your scene
anymore, boss.

155
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:03,655
Don't ever put your hands
on me again, okay?

156
00:26:03,727 --> 00:26:06,059
Say hi to your sister for me.

157
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:20,941
A Korean kid brought it in.
David Park.

158
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:24,111
It's a green Ford Torino.

159
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:27,481
Please don't drop this on me!

160
00:26:32,356 --> 00:26:34,051
I'm almost done.

161
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,796
Why don't you tell me why
you dragged me here, Brian?

162
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:49,838
You know they're going to capture Dom.
Maybe worse.

163
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:55,808
I don't want you getting tangled up
in this. So stay away from him.

164
00:26:56,747 --> 00:27:00,114
That's what you have to
say to me after 5 years?

165
00:27:01,485 --> 00:27:04,352
All of a sudden, you care
what happens to me.

166
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:10,125
What I did to you was wrong.

167
00:27:10,194 --> 00:27:14,460
I'm sorry. It was... It was the
hardest thing I've ever had to do.

168
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:17,867
I'm sorry, too, Brian.

169
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:23,236
I'm so sorry that you had to come
into my home and pretend to love me.

170
00:27:23,307 --> 00:27:25,707
I'm so sorry that you ripped
my family apart.

171
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:28,677
I'm very sorry that that was
hard for you.

172
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:34,008
I lied to you.

173
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:38,046
I lied to Dom. I lied to everybody.

174
00:27:38,522 --> 00:27:41,787
That's what I do best.
It's why the Feds recruited me.

175
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,826
Maybe you're lying to yourself.

176
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:50,794
Maybe you're not the good guy
pretending to be a bad guy.

177
00:27:51,268 --> 00:27:54,669
Maybe you're the bad guy
pretending to be the good guy.

178
00:27:54,738 --> 00:27:56,865
You ever think about that?

179
00:27:58,509 --> 00:27:59,999
Every day.

180
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:14,220
I always wondered,

181
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,258
why did you let my brother go that day?

182
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:22,254
I don't know.

183
00:28:32,176 --> 00:28:33,575
Shit.

184
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:37,738
Brian!

185
00:28:37,815 --> 00:28:40,841
I got the cross-checks on David Park
back and have a list of possibles.

186
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:43,352
What do you got?
All right. A 45-year-old male in a '06 Scion

187
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,513
with 3 reckless driving tickets.
No.

188
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:47,989
An '01 Chevy Tahoe.
No.

189
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:51,926
2 Mini Coopers, a '06 and a '07,
a Toyota hybrid.

190
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,658
Hell no.
A '98 Saturn, a '95 Sebring.

191
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:56,859
A '98 Nissan 240 with an illegal mod.

192
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:58,959
Wait. That's it.

193
00:28:59,036 --> 00:29:01,596
What?
The 240 with the illegal mod.

194
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:04,903
How do you know?
'Cause that's something I'd drive.

195
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:30,799
Don't! Don't! Don't!

196
00:29:42,446 --> 00:29:45,176
Green Torino, running nitro.

197
00:29:46,116 --> 00:29:47,811
Whose car?
I don't know, man.

198
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:50,877
I'm just the middleman. I swear!
I'm just the middleman!

199
00:29:55,726 --> 00:29:57,421
Wait, wait, wait.

200
00:29:58,028 --> 00:30:01,828
I don't know shit, man. I swear.
I just run cars for Braga, all right?

201
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:04,697
All I can do is get you in the race!
That's all I can do!

202
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:06,133
What race?

203
00:30:11,608 --> 00:30:13,371
Help! Come on, hold on!

204
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,810
Let me up, man! Come on!

205
00:30:26,957 --> 00:30:29,824
Come on, man, I don't know shit!
Just let me up!

206
00:30:29,893 --> 00:30:32,054
I told you, you got to talk to Braga!

207
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:33,118
Bring him up, Dom.

208
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:35,893
God! Don't drop me!
That's all I know!

209
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:38,491
Bring him up.

210
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:41,060
You here to take me in, O'Conner?

211
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:44,063
Shit! Shit!
Shut up!

212
00:30:46,944 --> 00:30:48,673
Letty was my friend, too.

213
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,373
You weren't anyone's friend.

214
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:53,575
Yo, can you guys talk about this later?
Now pull my ass up!

215
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,982
She was running for this guy, Braga,
and things went bad.

216
00:30:56,053 --> 00:30:57,077
Please!

217
00:30:57,154 --> 00:30:59,782
I'm going to get these guys, Dom.

218
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:02,087
Now let me do my job and bring him up.

219
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,627
I'm going to kill this Braga.

220
00:31:06,563 --> 00:31:07,757
God!

221
00:31:08,165 --> 00:31:10,929
And anyone else who gets in my way.

222
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:16,366
Hey!

223
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,598
Don't let go.

224
00:31:27,484 --> 00:31:28,781
O'Conner!

225
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:34,184
O'Conner! If you ever release
a witness of mine again...

226
00:31:38,595 --> 00:31:40,495
That's enough!
Don't touch me.

227
00:31:40,564 --> 00:31:41,997
I'm fine!
That's enough.

228
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:45,296
You're through, O'Conner!
I said that's enough!

229
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:48,362
Stasiak, go get
yourself cleaned up.

230
00:31:48,438 --> 00:31:50,668
What?
He hit me first! You...

231
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:52,766
This isn't the Cub Scouts!

232
00:31:52,843 --> 00:31:56,074
Now, go on!
You're bleeding on my floor.

233
00:32:05,689 --> 00:32:08,522
O'Conner, do you know the difference
between a cop and a criminal?

234
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:11,026
What?
One bad judgment call.

235
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:14,690
Keep your shit in line, son.

236
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:20,398
Have a good time.

237
00:32:23,407 --> 00:32:25,068
Take a seat.

238
00:32:29,012 --> 00:32:33,642
Good news. We have intel that
Braga's number 2, Ramon Campos,

239
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:35,912
will hold a street race
in Koreatown tomorrow night

240
00:32:35,986 --> 00:32:38,113
to fill a slot on his team.

241
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:41,351
They've already chosen
3 drivers from previous races.

242
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,987
Our newest informant,
Mr. David Park,

243
00:32:45,062 --> 00:32:47,826
has been kind enough
to get us into the race.

244
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,530
O'Conner, you're up.

245
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,930
Let me guess, winner gets the slot.

246
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:04,242
All right, so these are all the imports
the city has in impound.

247
00:33:04,314 --> 00:33:06,475
Okay, nice.
Pick your poison.

248
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,781
All right, 2206.
I crashed one of those.

249
00:33:09,853 --> 00:33:14,483
3418 and 2765.

250
00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:17,827
Okay, so which one do you want?

251
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,590
I want them all.

252
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:51,390
Standard issue tracking device.

253
00:33:51,461 --> 00:33:53,395
Boss wants to know where
you are at all times.

254
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:47,110
You want to play with it?

255
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,211
Hey!

256
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:52,053
What are you looking at, nutsack?

257
00:34:52,122 --> 00:34:53,885
I don't know.
You tell me.

258
00:34:53,957 --> 00:34:56,221
The racer wants what Dwight's got.

259
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:59,262
See, but, ladies, Dwight's
already on the team.

260
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:01,297
You got to be fast if you want
to drive for Braga.

261
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:04,198
Is there a problem here?
No.

262
00:35:06,703 --> 00:35:08,728
You one of Park's guys, blondie?

263
00:35:08,805 --> 00:35:10,295
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

264
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:12,508
Follow me.

265
00:35:15,846 --> 00:35:17,643
See you later, punk.

266
00:35:18,415 --> 00:35:19,609
You, too, punk.

267
00:35:31,995 --> 00:35:34,122
Bull's-eye, coño, come on!

268
00:35:40,203 --> 00:35:41,397
We can do this all day.

269
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,942
You all know why you're here.

270
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:51,103
Good drivers

271
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,580
are a dime a dozen.

272
00:35:55,018 --> 00:35:59,284
Man, every corner's got a chingadera
tuner racing for pinks.

273
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:03,115
That's not what Braga
has got me looking for.

274
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:08,391
Braga wants someone that would sell
their abuelita to be behind the wheel.

275
00:36:09,966 --> 00:36:14,062
Someone that drives their 10-second cars
not in a straight line,

276
00:36:14,137 --> 00:36:18,369
but to push it and make it through
places no one else would take it.

277
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,634
Real drivers.

278
00:36:22,779 --> 00:36:24,838
So, what are we hauling?

279
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:29,285
For the money Braga's paying,
you don't need to know.

280
00:36:29,352 --> 00:36:32,014
You just said you wanted real drivers.

281
00:36:33,957 --> 00:36:37,188
A real driver knows
exactly what's in his car.

282
00:36:42,265 --> 00:36:44,062
Mira, real driver,

283
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:48,131
nobody's forcing you to race.

284
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:49,968
You the boss?

285
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:54,005
Or am I talking to the boss?

286
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,914
Do I look like a boss?

287
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:04,679
My job is to find the best drivers,
period.

288
00:37:04,754 --> 00:37:08,383
Whoever wins the race
gets the info. We cool?

289
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,854
Are we cool?

290
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:18,728
Yeah, we're cool.

291
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:21,227
No, we ain't cool, man.

292
00:37:21,972 --> 00:37:24,133
Who's closing these streets?

293
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:28,502
No one. That's the point.

294
00:37:40,423 --> 00:37:43,654
Please wait while
directions are downloaded.

295
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:51,867
Proceed to the highlighted route.

296
00:37:52,636 --> 00:37:53,728
10,

297
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:56,666
9,

298
00:37:58,241 --> 00:37:59,503
8,

299
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:02,406
7,

300
00:38:03,813 --> 00:38:04,939
6...

301
00:38:05,015 --> 00:38:08,314
You sure you want to do this?
A lot has changed.

302
00:38:09,252 --> 00:38:11,083
4...
You' re right.

303
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,150
3,

304
00:38:14,691 --> 00:38:15,851
2,

305
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,520
1,

306
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,090
go!

307
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:31,168
Right turn ahead.

308
00:38:34,477 --> 00:38:37,674
You are now 5 miles
from your destination.

309
00:39:03,673 --> 00:39:05,504
How's my ass look, Chia Pet?

310
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:07,901
Ghetto Smurf.

311
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,698
Dead man driving.

312
00:39:38,341 --> 00:39:39,638
Come on!

313
00:39:40,944 --> 00:39:42,707
Right turn ahead.

314
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:02,858
Shit!

315
00:40:08,171 --> 00:40:09,468
Damn.

316
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:10,938
Rerouting.

317
00:40:17,947 --> 00:40:19,380
Rerouting.

318
00:40:28,024 --> 00:40:30,185
Proceed straight ahead.

319
00:40:34,497 --> 00:40:35,862
Rerouting.

320
00:40:45,675 --> 00:40:46,869
Shit.

321
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,540
Rerouting.
Just shut up!

322
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:57,752
You are 2. 6 miles from destination.

323
00:41:00,657 --> 00:41:02,352
Oops, I didn't see you.

324
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:08,787
You are now 4 and one-half miles
from your destination.

325
00:41:41,531 --> 00:41:44,398
U- turn, if possible.
Are you kidding me?

326
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:48,528
You are now 4. 2 miles
from your destination.

327
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,773
Sorry, car.

328
00:41:59,082 --> 00:42:01,573
You are now one mile
from your destination.

329
00:42:01,651 --> 00:42:03,846
Yeah, guess who's back, Dom?

330
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,121
Let's go!

331
00:42:12,595 --> 00:42:14,222
Nice car, baby!

332
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,103
Bitch!

333
00:43:01,411 --> 00:43:04,505
You are now one-quarter mile
from your destination.

334
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:24,758
Too early, Dom.

335
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:45,044
No!

336
00:43:45,655 --> 00:43:47,418
Still a buster.

337
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,954
You have reached your destination.
Goodbye.

338
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:09,042
At least we know you can't beat me
straight up.

339
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:10,943
I didn't know there were any rules.

340
00:44:12,882 --> 00:44:14,577
Now that's what I call real driving.

341
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:16,050
No, that's bullshit, man!

342
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:18,087
Go cry to your mama, eh?

343
00:44:20,523 --> 00:44:22,514
You work for Braga now.

344
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:25,724
When the GPS calls, you follow.

345
00:44:30,733 --> 00:44:32,530
Driver's license.

346
00:44:32,602 --> 00:44:35,162
What driver's license?

347
00:44:35,738 --> 00:44:37,262
Thumb.

348
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:43,742
Cell phone number.

349
00:44:48,818 --> 00:44:51,013
The print is for Campos.

350
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:53,586
The number is for me.

351
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,425
Yo, nutsack!

352
00:44:58,494 --> 00:45:02,089
Let me tell you something, man,
muscle beats import every time.

353
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:04,963
You know what I'm saying?
Every time!

354
00:45:05,835 --> 00:45:08,861
Ladies, let's get on
back to Papa Dwight's.

355
00:45:15,511 --> 00:45:18,571
Papa Dwight wants you
to take off your shoes.

356
00:45:19,215 --> 00:45:22,184
Dwight likes feet.
Take off your shoes.

357
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,677
So beautiful.

358
00:45:26,789 --> 00:45:28,780
Dwight likes this foot a lot.

359
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,499
Yes, baby!

360
00:45:39,669 --> 00:45:41,864
Daddy Dwight loves...
FBI!

361
00:45:41,938 --> 00:45:43,667
Hey! Yo, what are you doing?

362
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,868
I didn't do nothing, man!
Dwight didn't do nothing!

363
00:45:46,943 --> 00:45:49,411
Hey, no! Stay! Where you going?
Bye, Dwight!

364
00:45:49,479 --> 00:45:50,707
No, what did I do?

365
00:45:51,881 --> 00:45:53,974
You're under arrest
for distribution of meth.

366
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:57,417
Meth? Dwight's never
touched that shit, bro!

367
00:45:57,487 --> 00:45:58,511
Dwight has now.

368
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:00,988
Yo, that ain't mine! No!

369
00:46:01,057 --> 00:46:03,218
You know that's never
gonna stick, right?

370
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:05,522
Yeah, it's not supposed to.

371
00:46:08,264 --> 00:46:10,198
Live it up!
Live it up!

372
00:47:05,688 --> 00:47:07,178
Yeah, Corona.

373
00:47:10,193 --> 00:47:11,558
That's too bad about Dwight.

374
00:47:11,627 --> 00:47:15,085
Having the Feds raid your house
the same night you make the team.

375
00:47:15,164 --> 00:47:17,189
So unfortunate.

376
00:47:17,266 --> 00:47:20,667
I wish I could say I was surprised
to see you here.

377
00:47:22,271 --> 00:47:25,536
What's to stop someone
from telling them you're a cop?

378
00:47:25,608 --> 00:47:29,374
Probably the same thing that's keeping me
from telling them why you're really here.

379
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:31,675
What up, fellows?
Hey, how you doing?

380
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:34,410
Great. You having a good time?
Yeah, a great time.

381
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:37,009
Come on, let's have a better time.

382
00:47:37,587 --> 00:47:41,114
How's your car?
It took a nasty bump.

383
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:42,748
It'll be ready.

384
00:47:42,825 --> 00:47:46,192
I also heard you just
got out of County.

385
00:47:46,262 --> 00:47:47,820
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

386
00:47:48,164 --> 00:47:49,927
You know a guy named Jim Garcia?

387
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:54,026
Nah. Big place.
Lots of names, lots of faces.

388
00:47:55,538 --> 00:47:58,598
And you, you're wanted by
a lot of people, homes.

389
00:47:58,674 --> 00:48:01,268
Yeah, that kind of heat
can't be good for business.

390
00:48:01,344 --> 00:48:04,279
Yeah, well, that depends
on how you look at things.

391
00:48:04,347 --> 00:48:06,713
I go down, I do time.

392
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:09,445
I do real time.

393
00:48:10,486 --> 00:48:15,048
I don't know about your other drivers,
but when I see flashing lights in my mirror,

394
00:48:15,124 --> 00:48:16,614
I don't stop.

395
00:48:21,998 --> 00:48:23,989
Do you know each other?

396
00:48:28,104 --> 00:48:30,231
He used to date my sister.

397
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,671
I see.

398
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:37,636
You're a lucky man.
How's that?

399
00:48:38,681 --> 00:48:40,672
You're still breathing.

400
00:48:46,722 --> 00:48:50,749
To the ladies we've loved
and the ladies we've lost.

401
00:48:59,502 --> 00:49:01,527
So, what's Braga about?

402
00:49:03,439 --> 00:49:05,339
You know, he's just one of us.

403
00:49:05,408 --> 00:49:08,866
Came up from the streets.
Down for el barrio.

404
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:11,175
Now he's a shot caller.

405
00:49:12,014 --> 00:49:13,879
The boss of bosses.

406
00:49:14,517 --> 00:49:16,781
See all these cats in here?

407
00:49:17,386 --> 00:49:20,048
Any one of them would die for Braga.

408
00:49:20,122 --> 00:49:21,749
Including you?

409
00:49:23,893 --> 00:49:25,520
Especially me.

410
00:49:35,338 --> 00:49:37,101
Enjoy the party, fellows.
Club's yours.

411
00:49:37,173 --> 00:49:40,404
Whatever you want, booze,
broads, it's all good.

412
00:49:43,846 --> 00:49:45,370
Braga's mine.

413
00:49:48,951 --> 00:49:51,351
I'm taking the whole house down.

414
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:53,520
Good luck.

415
00:52:01,283 --> 00:52:04,013
Something interests you
about this car?

416
00:52:04,653 --> 00:52:06,883
Just admiring the body work.

417
00:52:08,491 --> 00:52:12,450
Are you one of those boys
who prefers cars to women?

418
00:52:15,931 --> 00:52:20,664
I'm one of those boys that appreciates
a fine body, regardless of the make.

419
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,773
Your car?

420
00:52:29,845 --> 00:52:31,506
It's Fenix's car.

421
00:52:32,715 --> 00:52:36,776
You'll meet him at the rendezvous.
He'll be leading you.

422
00:52:38,287 --> 00:52:39,686
So now

423
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:43,490
that I know your taste in cars,

424
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:46,084
tell me, what about your women?

425
00:52:48,097 --> 00:52:50,258
It all starts with the eyes.

426
00:52:52,768 --> 00:52:57,967
She's got to have those kind of eyes
that can look right through the bullshit

427
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,133
to the good in someone.

428
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:07,943
20% angel, 80% devil.

429
00:53:09,618 --> 00:53:11,449
Down to earth.

430
00:53:13,289 --> 00:53:17,453
Ain't afraid to get a little engine
grease under her fingernails.

431
00:53:24,433 --> 00:53:27,027
That doesn't sound anything like me.

432
00:53:29,705 --> 00:53:31,070
It ain't.

433
00:53:39,148 --> 00:53:40,172
Hi.
Hi.

434
00:53:40,249 --> 00:53:43,309
I got a gift for you.
All right.

435
00:53:43,385 --> 00:53:45,945
A dirty shot glass,
just what I always wanted.

436
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:47,613
I got these from the club last night.

437
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,658
There's 2 sets of prints here.
Run them both.

438
00:53:49,725 --> 00:53:53,252
I know one of these is Campos'.
I think the other might be Braga's.

439
00:53:53,329 --> 00:53:55,889
And you're gonna have
to go beyond Interpol.

440
00:53:55,965 --> 00:53:58,331
So, that means I have to contact
individual agencies,

441
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,960
and that could take weeks. Okay.

442
00:54:16,051 --> 00:54:17,040
Yeah.

443
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:20,247
That's your third traffic violation
in less than 3 blocks.

444
00:54:20,356 --> 00:54:22,347
Slow it down, O'Conner.

445
00:54:23,025 --> 00:54:24,720
Sure thing, Dad.

446
00:54:53,822 --> 00:54:54,880
He stopped.

447
00:55:49,478 --> 00:55:50,945
We lost him.

448
00:55:51,013 --> 00:55:52,537
He killed the tracker.
We don't know that.

449
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:54,845
I'm telling you, he killed the tracker.
We don't know that yet!

450
00:55:54,917 --> 00:55:56,851
Get the bird overhead.

451
00:55:57,953 --> 00:56:00,979
Right now,
I'm moving north, 33', 56'...

452
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:06,393
All clear.

453
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:31,650
Base, flag nine, I'm at Angels 5.

454
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:35,349
I don't have a tally on the target.
Repeat, I don't have a tally on the target.

455
00:56:35,424 --> 00:56:37,153
They' re gone, there's no one
down there.

456
00:56:37,226 --> 00:56:38,557
Damn it!

457
00:56:49,605 --> 00:56:54,406
This ain't right, bro. Nobody said
nothing about being locked in no truck.

458
00:56:54,476 --> 00:56:56,205
Tell me about it.

459
00:56:58,981 --> 00:57:00,744
Hey. Hey!

460
00:57:02,451 --> 00:57:05,477
Yo!
Where do you think they're taking us?

461
00:57:05,554 --> 00:57:07,146
Don't matter.

462
00:57:10,092 --> 00:57:12,925
We're all just along for the ride now.

463
00:57:24,006 --> 00:57:25,997
Welcome to Mexico, boys.

464
00:57:31,747 --> 00:57:34,147
There are helicopters
and surveillance cameras

465
00:57:34,216 --> 00:57:36,707
that scan for heat
signatures at the border.

466
00:57:36,785 --> 00:57:40,744
But there are blind spots that
I can guide you through via satellite.

467
00:57:40,823 --> 00:57:45,317
There can be no margin of error,
so you must follow my every direction.

468
00:57:46,028 --> 00:57:47,393
Any questions?

469
00:57:49,465 --> 00:57:51,990
I thought Fenix was gonna be here.

470
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,229
He'll meet you out there.

471
00:58:02,144 --> 00:58:04,476
All right, everybody, sync up.

472
00:58:07,249 --> 00:58:09,149
Good luck, gentlemen.

473
00:58:22,564 --> 00:58:24,122
Satellite linkup engaged.

474
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:28,527
Keep proceeding northbound
at current speed.

475
00:58:32,508 --> 00:58:34,373
Stay close to Fenix.

476
00:58:35,544 --> 00:58:36,977
He'll lead you across.

477
00:58:51,193 --> 00:58:54,720
I got a heat signature northbound
along Legardo Ravine.

478
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:01,727
Thermal imaging window on the Mexico
side's gonna be down for about 45 seconds.

479
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:03,704
Get the camera on it.

480
00:59:03,772 --> 00:59:07,606
Manual override. Rerouting camera
to designated coordinates.

481
00:59:10,779 --> 00:59:13,577
Hurry it up.
You guys have been tagged.

482
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:24,689
Shit.

483
00:59:25,861 --> 00:59:28,295
Toretto, get back in formation.

484
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:32,559
Reimaging commencing.

485
00:59:41,343 --> 00:59:43,277
I don't see anything.

486
00:59:43,345 --> 00:59:44,573
They're gone.

487
00:59:46,615 --> 00:59:48,549
Get the helicopters to cover it.

488
00:59:52,654 --> 00:59:55,782
Base, we're 40 seconds
out from Legardo Ravine.

489
00:59:56,658 --> 00:59:58,285
They're sending a helicopter.

490
00:59:59,928 --> 01:00:01,793
You have 30 seconds.

491
01:00:10,606 --> 01:00:13,700
North 32' 33', west 116' 49'.

492
01:00:20,215 --> 01:00:22,046
The window is closing fast.

493
01:00:22,117 --> 01:00:25,280
You need to get out of there before
they send ground support.

494
01:00:31,493 --> 01:00:33,154
15 seconds.

495
01:00:38,634 --> 01:00:40,966
Base, target is at 2 miles.

496
01:00:54,149 --> 01:00:56,344
You're running out of time.

497
01:00:59,388 --> 01:01:01,447
You need to get out now!

498
01:01:13,435 --> 01:01:17,462
Base, we're at north 32' 33',
west 116' 49'.

499
01:01:17,539 --> 01:01:21,407
We have no visual contact.
Roll ground units for confirmation.

500
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:43,662
Sloppy!

501
01:01:44,366 --> 01:01:45,890
Very sloppy!

502
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,565
What are you doing, man?

503
01:01:56,078 --> 01:01:57,409
Come on.

504
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:01,846
Get out.

505
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,582
Come on, man.

506
01:02:06,655 --> 01:02:08,646
Come on, today, man.
Come on, let's go.

507
01:02:08,724 --> 01:02:10,589
Hey, don't touch me.
Hey, don't touch me, man!

508
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,689
Hey, I said don't touch me, man!

509
01:02:13,762 --> 01:02:15,286
Hey, look, dawg, don't put
your hands on me.

510
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:16,922
Hey, Malik, chill, bro.

511
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,227
Yo, man, what's up
with your boy?

512
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,165
Hey, boss man!

513
01:02:23,105 --> 01:02:24,834
What did you say?

514
01:02:24,906 --> 01:02:28,637
I said only pussies run nitrometh.

515
01:02:31,279 --> 01:02:33,338
You looked under my hood?

516
01:02:40,255 --> 01:02:41,950
I'm talking to you.

517
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:44,254
Got something on your mind?

518
01:02:45,093 --> 01:02:46,424
'70 Plymouth.

519
01:02:49,431 --> 01:02:50,693
Her name was Letty.

520
01:02:53,835 --> 01:02:54,927
Yo.

521
01:02:56,471 --> 01:02:58,200
Where's my money?

522
01:02:59,908 --> 01:03:02,274
And somebody
wrecked her car.

523
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:11,314
I wrecked her car.

524
01:03:15,891 --> 01:03:16,915
You remember her face?

525
01:03:22,698 --> 01:03:23,687
Huh?

526
01:03:24,566 --> 01:03:26,193
'Cause I don't.

527
01:03:27,569 --> 01:03:30,231
Last time I saw it, it was burning.

528
01:03:44,052 --> 01:03:45,417
Now what?

529
01:03:47,055 --> 01:03:49,785
I'm going to enjoy
what happens next.

530
01:04:23,892 --> 01:04:25,382
Dom, get in!

531
01:04:26,661 --> 01:04:28,356
Get in! Come on!

532
01:04:30,365 --> 01:04:34,199
Come on! Get in the fucking car!
Let's go! Hurry up!

533
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:02,824
What have you got, Trinh?

534
01:05:02,898 --> 01:05:05,492
We're contacting agencies
in multiple countries.

535
01:05:05,567 --> 01:05:10,561
Unfortunately, most of them have to
manually scan their prints for us to upload.

536
01:05:11,406 --> 01:05:13,499
O'Conner's on line 5.

537
01:05:13,575 --> 01:05:15,668
And, sir, you should see this.

538
01:05:15,744 --> 01:05:17,234
Thank you.

539
01:05:27,622 --> 01:05:28,714
Talk to me, O'Conner.

540
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:31,386
Where the hell have you been?
I got the shipment.

541
01:05:31,459 --> 01:05:34,451
"I got the shipment,"
or "we got the shipment"?

542
01:05:34,529 --> 01:05:36,588
What are you talking about?

543
01:05:36,665 --> 01:05:41,125
Traffic cams in the area picked up
pictures of you and Toretto together.

544
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:47,003
Listen to me, O'Conner. Bring in
the shipment and bring in Toretto.

545
01:05:47,442 --> 01:05:50,104
But I thought the point was to get Braga.
We got an opportunity here.

546
01:05:50,178 --> 01:05:52,772
Brian, the clock stopped ticking.

547
01:05:53,648 --> 01:05:55,946
Bring them in. Are we clear?

548
01:06:00,288 --> 01:06:01,619
O'Conner?

549
01:06:11,633 --> 01:06:14,466
So this is what $60 million looks like.

550
01:06:16,204 --> 01:06:18,832
Yeah, we got to get you to a doctor.

551
01:06:18,907 --> 01:06:21,569
We got to find a place to hide this.

552
01:06:24,179 --> 01:06:25,339
I got a spot.

553
01:06:35,423 --> 01:06:38,358
502, wet reckless.
I need a 48-hour hold.

554
01:06:40,462 --> 01:06:42,327
Out back. Any spot you can find.

555
01:06:47,469 --> 01:06:49,369
You sure about this?

556
01:06:50,338 --> 01:06:56,504
Yeah. The last place they'll check,
their own impound yard. Trust me.

557
01:07:02,984 --> 01:07:04,884
You know, I've been thinking,

558
01:07:04,953 --> 01:07:07,444
when you blew up your car back
there, you blew up mine, too.

559
01:07:07,522 --> 01:07:10,013
Yeah?
Yeah.

560
01:07:10,091 --> 01:07:12,651
So now you owe me a 10-second car.

561
01:07:13,995 --> 01:07:16,259
Is that right?
Yeah.

562
01:07:27,542 --> 01:07:29,237
Now we're even.

563
01:07:44,926 --> 01:07:47,861
Is this your way of keeping me
away from him?

564
01:07:47,929 --> 01:07:51,763
You're the only one I could call.
He's my brother, of course.

565
01:07:59,374 --> 01:08:01,467
The bullet's not in there.

566
01:08:09,017 --> 01:08:12,976
I'm gonna clean it and stitch it up.
It's going to hurt.

567
01:08:13,054 --> 01:08:15,522
I bet you're going to enjoy this.

568
01:08:16,191 --> 01:08:17,522
A little.

569
01:08:20,495 --> 01:08:22,929
Want some of this?
Yeah.

570
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:25,023
It's spicy.

571
01:08:26,801 --> 01:08:28,428
I like it hot.

572
01:08:29,537 --> 01:08:31,767
Dom, what are you doing?

573
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,775
You reached first,
you have to say grace.

574
01:08:45,053 --> 01:08:48,955
Thank you, Lord,
for blessing this table.

575
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:55,159
With food, family and friendship.

576
01:09:28,897 --> 01:09:31,229
You asked me why I let Dom go.

577
01:09:33,334 --> 01:09:35,996
I think it's because at that moment,

578
01:09:37,705 --> 01:09:40,538
I respected him more than I did myself.

579
01:09:44,913 --> 01:09:46,107
Yeah.

580
01:09:47,715 --> 01:09:52,812
One thing I learned from Dom is that nothing
really matters unless you have a code.

581
01:09:56,057 --> 01:09:58,321
And what's your code, Brian?

582
01:10:00,728 --> 01:10:02,491
I'm working on it.

583
01:10:37,398 --> 01:10:38,956
Shit. Hey, Dom.

584
01:10:39,033 --> 01:10:41,593
When were you gonna tell me?
Dom, what are you doing?

585
01:10:41,669 --> 01:10:43,637
When were you gonna tell me
you were running Letty?

586
01:10:43,705 --> 01:10:46,037
Let me explain...
When were you gonna...

587
01:10:51,479 --> 01:10:52,776
Dom, stop!

588
01:10:52,847 --> 01:10:55,008
You don't understand.
I don't understand?

589
01:10:55,116 --> 01:10:56,310
Stop!

590
01:11:00,488 --> 01:11:01,682
She did it for...

591
01:11:04,792 --> 01:11:06,316
Dom, stop!

592
01:11:06,394 --> 01:11:08,521
Dom, stop it! Please stop!

593
01:11:17,972 --> 01:11:21,601
She did it for you, Dom!
She did it for you!

594
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:30,414
Letty came to me to clear your name
in exchange for bringing down Braga.

595
01:11:33,488 --> 01:11:35,979
She just wanted you to come home!

596
01:11:53,174 --> 01:11:54,971
I'm sorry, Dom!

597
01:11:55,043 --> 01:11:56,476
I'm sorry!

598
01:12:21,302 --> 01:12:27,172
You better have one hell of an
explanation. You disobeyed a direct order.

599
01:12:28,042 --> 01:12:30,033
Where's the shipment?
It's safe.

600
01:12:30,111 --> 01:12:31,908
It's safe.

601
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,881
Look, we could use the shipment
to parade in front of the media,

602
01:12:34,949 --> 01:12:36,883
get a few hundred pounds
of heroin off the street,

603
01:12:36,951 --> 01:12:40,682
but Braga's just gonna send another shipment
next week and the week after that.

604
01:12:40,755 --> 01:12:42,882
Let's use the shipment to lure Braga out

605
01:12:42,957 --> 01:12:45,016
and lop the head off
a multi-billion dollar cartel.

606
01:12:45,093 --> 01:12:47,493
And how do you suggest we do that?

607
01:12:47,562 --> 01:12:49,530
A hand-to-hand exchange with Braga.

608
01:12:49,597 --> 01:12:50,996
He'll never show.

609
01:12:51,065 --> 01:12:52,828
He can't afford not to.

610
01:13:02,977 --> 01:13:04,638
You got a plan?

611
01:13:06,147 --> 01:13:07,808
There's a price.

612
01:13:10,718 --> 01:13:13,482
We bag Braga, you let Toretto walk.

613
01:13:22,297 --> 01:13:24,492
Yes?
It's Dom.

614
01:13:25,533 --> 01:13:27,831
I was just thinking about you.

615
01:13:28,236 --> 01:13:32,138
You know, when I gave you my number,
I was hoping you'd call.

616
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:35,265
But not under these circumstances.

617
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:38,738
What circumstances?
Me being alive?

618
01:13:39,781 --> 01:13:41,715
Don't take it personally.

619
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:44,150
It's just business.

620
01:13:44,218 --> 01:13:45,810
I got some business of my own.

621
01:13:47,121 --> 01:13:48,554
Get Campos.

622
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:52,492
It's them.

623
01:13:56,831 --> 01:13:57,820
Uh-huh.

624
01:13:58,066 --> 01:14:02,059
Was that how Braga inspires loyalty?
Killing his drivers?

625
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:04,936
One can always find more drivers.

626
01:14:07,442 --> 01:14:08,670
I want to trade.

627
01:14:08,976 --> 01:14:11,001
Braga doesn't negotiate.

628
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:12,103
Fine.

629
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:17,049
You explain to him how all of a sudden
$60 million worth of product disappears.

630
01:14:17,785 --> 01:14:20,049
I know that can't be good for business.

631
01:14:21,155 --> 01:14:22,679
What do you want?

632
01:14:23,191 --> 01:14:27,457
6 million cash, delivered by Braga himself.

633
01:14:30,131 --> 01:14:31,723
I don't like being shot at.

634
01:14:32,133 --> 01:14:35,364
I ain't gonna put my neck out again
unless he's got something to lose, too.

635
01:14:35,436 --> 01:14:37,028
He'll never go for it.

636
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:40,734
Either I deal with Braga, or you do.

637
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:46,304
When and where?

638
01:15:01,362 --> 01:15:05,264
Sir, players are onsite.
Holding positions at the perimeter.

639
01:15:05,733 --> 01:15:08,327
All right. Listen up.
Everybody stay frosty.

640
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:11,099
We don't move a muscle until
O'Conner gives the signal.

641
01:15:11,172 --> 01:15:13,868
When he gets the money,
you know what to do.

642
01:15:14,442 --> 01:15:16,933
Well, the good news is,
when we get this guy,

643
01:15:17,011 --> 01:15:19,411
you walk out of here a free man.

644
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:21,214
Is that what they told you?

645
01:15:21,282 --> 01:15:22,943
Yeah, that's the deal.

646
01:15:23,017 --> 01:15:26,418
You still put milk and cookies out
for Santa Claus?

647
01:15:27,722 --> 01:15:28,882
Yeah.

648
01:15:33,694 --> 01:15:34,786
Here.

649
01:15:34,862 --> 01:15:36,921
In case things go shitty.

650
01:15:41,903 --> 01:15:43,962
Just like old times?

651
01:15:44,038 --> 01:15:45,300
Yeah.

652
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:50,207
You dropped something.

653
01:15:50,278 --> 01:15:52,473
That's what you wanted, right?
Dom...

654
01:16:07,528 --> 01:16:10,156
He's harmless.
Don't worry about him.

655
01:16:11,933 --> 01:16:14,424
And he's really sorry about Letty.

656
01:16:16,571 --> 01:16:18,334
Where's our stuff?

657
01:16:21,108 --> 01:16:24,373
You mean the stuff that
used to be in here, right?

658
01:16:25,546 --> 01:16:29,346
Well, you'll see it when we see Braga.
That was the deal.

659
01:16:30,318 --> 01:16:31,717
No worries.

660
01:16:32,119 --> 01:16:34,110
Braga keeps his word.

661
01:17:18,099 --> 01:17:19,589
$2 million.

662
01:17:20,701 --> 01:17:23,431
You get the rest when I get my property.

663
01:17:27,775 --> 01:17:29,436
Stasiak.
We got a match.

664
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:31,535
The fingerprint's Braga's 100%.

665
01:17:31,612 --> 01:17:34,103
Just waiting on facial confirmation
via fax.

666
01:17:34,181 --> 01:17:36,149
I got a question for you.

667
01:17:36,217 --> 01:17:39,948
You wearing pink when you were
clawing your way out of el barrio?

668
01:17:41,222 --> 01:17:42,689
Order all agents to move in.

669
01:17:42,757 --> 01:17:45,885
We got confirmation.
Primary suspect wearing gray suit.

670
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:46,984
Let's move.

671
01:17:47,061 --> 01:17:48,995
Sir, O'Conner hasn't
given us the signal yet.

672
01:17:49,063 --> 01:17:52,396
What part of that didn't you understand?
We just got confirmation. Do it!

673
01:17:52,466 --> 01:17:55,833
Secure primary suspect
in gray suit. Repeat!

674
01:17:55,903 --> 01:17:58,497
Secure primary suspect in gray suit.

675
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:14,649
You're thinking what I'm thinking, right?

676
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:19,085
He ain't Braga.

677
01:18:23,664 --> 01:18:24,653
Oh, shit.

678
01:18:24,865 --> 01:18:27,095
Drop your weapons!
FBI!

679
01:18:27,535 --> 01:18:28,832
Get down!

680
01:18:32,306 --> 01:18:34,001
Get out of here!

681
01:18:38,112 --> 01:18:39,977
Get out of here, Dom!

682
01:18:44,285 --> 01:18:45,843
Run him down.

683
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:47,582
Go!

684
01:18:48,255 --> 01:18:49,916
Campos is Braga!

685
01:18:57,398 --> 01:18:58,695
Come on.

686
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,167
Approaching primary target.

687
01:19:08,709 --> 01:19:10,870
Primary suspect is secure.

688
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:15,344
He was under your nose
the whole time.

689
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:17,645
Now Braga's escaped.

690
01:19:17,718 --> 01:19:20,710
Toretto's heading south, probably
long across the border by now.

691
01:19:20,788 --> 01:19:23,018
Do you have any idea the kind
of trouble you're in, O'Conner?

692
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:25,058
I was doing my job.

693
01:19:25,126 --> 01:19:27,651
He ain't the first bad guy you
helped escape the law's grasp.

694
01:19:27,728 --> 01:19:29,719
As of now, you're being taken
off active duty,

695
01:19:29,797 --> 01:19:32,732
until this house can
mount a formal inquiry.

696
01:19:34,935 --> 01:19:36,664
What about Braga?

697
01:19:37,738 --> 01:19:40,070
That's no longer your concern.

698
01:19:50,484 --> 01:19:51,974
We now know where Braga is, right?

699
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:55,511
Customs tracked him via satellite
to his home base in Tecali, Mexico.

700
01:19:55,589 --> 01:19:58,023
Mexico is out of our jurisdiction.

701
01:20:00,828 --> 01:20:02,420
The fact is

702
01:20:02,496 --> 01:20:06,592
the brass will be so busy holding
press conferences over the seizure,

703
01:20:06,667 --> 01:20:08,794
we'll skate under the radar.

704
01:20:09,236 --> 01:20:12,296
I thought we signed on
to do the right thing.

705
01:20:50,644 --> 01:20:52,771
Everyone's looking for you.

706
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:54,772
I'm right here.

707
01:20:56,083 --> 01:20:57,448
It's nice to see you've gone
with the times

708
01:20:57,518 --> 01:21:01,079
and switched to electronic fuel injection.
Looks good.

709
01:21:02,223 --> 01:21:04,282
Buster became a gearhead.

710
01:21:08,395 --> 01:21:10,192
I'm going with you.

711
01:21:14,101 --> 01:21:16,763
I don't plan on bringing anyone back.

712
01:21:18,739 --> 01:21:20,070
I know.

713
01:21:28,816 --> 01:21:30,477
Hit that throttle.

714
01:21:56,777 --> 01:21:57,903
Hey.

715
01:22:39,687 --> 01:22:42,679
How do you say goodbye
to your only brother?

716
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:46,258
You don't.

717
01:23:55,195 --> 01:23:57,561
I thought you weren't gonna show up.

718
01:23:57,631 --> 01:23:59,258
You saved my life.

719
01:24:00,134 --> 01:24:02,602
I'm willing to return the favor.

720
01:24:06,473 --> 01:24:08,964
This will help get you to Braga.

721
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:14,272
Dom.

722
01:24:15,282 --> 01:24:17,910
Going in there is suicide.

723
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:28,223
I have no choice.

724
01:24:31,799 --> 01:24:34,267
You must have
loved her very much.

725
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:55,015
So this is where my jurisdiction ends.

726
01:25:00,828 --> 01:25:02,989
And this is where mine begins.

727
01:27:13,393 --> 01:27:15,258
You ain't forgiven.

728
01:27:18,732 --> 01:27:20,859
You boys want to arrest me?

729
01:27:23,937 --> 01:27:25,962
No, we're beyond that.

730
01:27:27,074 --> 01:27:29,838
You can't buy your way
out of this one.

731
01:27:31,245 --> 01:27:32,872
You and me...

732
01:27:34,114 --> 01:27:36,947
You and me, we're not so different.

733
01:27:38,685 --> 01:27:40,277
You're no hero.

734
01:27:50,931 --> 01:27:52,592
You're right.

735
01:27:55,702 --> 01:27:59,035
And that's why you're going back
across the border.

736
01:28:05,045 --> 01:28:06,774
But Fenix is mine.

737
01:28:07,748 --> 01:28:08,840
You got it.

738
01:28:31,104 --> 01:28:32,264
Shit!

739
01:28:37,277 --> 01:28:40,838
You'll make it a couple of miles out,
if you're lucky.

740
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,630
You know where you're going?

741
01:29:36,703 --> 01:29:38,864
You want to borrow my GPS?

742
01:29:42,576 --> 01:29:44,271
Where are your boys at?

743
01:29:44,344 --> 01:29:45,902
Are they going to show up or what?

744
01:29:49,383 --> 01:29:51,408
Careful what you ask for.

745
01:30:07,701 --> 01:30:09,931
Just stop. Just stop the car.

746
01:30:30,123 --> 01:30:31,818
Right behind you.

747
01:30:46,673 --> 01:30:49,767
Dom, head to the tunnel.
Let's use the tunnel.

748
01:31:17,003 --> 01:31:18,971
Get out of here, Brian.

749
01:31:26,713 --> 01:31:30,205
You sure you know where
the tunnels are? You sure?

750
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:32,514
Yeah. I'd hold on.

751
01:31:35,589 --> 01:31:37,250
This might hurt.

752
01:31:50,637 --> 01:31:52,798
You're in my world now, baby!

753
01:32:21,435 --> 01:32:23,995
That's it, baby! End of the road.

754
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:25,503
Now what?

755
01:32:26,306 --> 01:32:27,398
Game over.

756
01:32:27,474 --> 01:32:28,998
No, no, no.

757
01:32:58,638 --> 01:33:00,037
Come on!

758
01:34:19,252 --> 01:34:20,344
Hey!

759
01:34:21,454 --> 01:34:23,285
Get me out of here!

760
01:35:53,446 --> 01:35:54,845
Pussy.

761
01:36:12,265 --> 01:36:13,857
Let me see that.

762
01:36:16,436 --> 01:36:18,802
Yeah. Just keep pressure there.

763
01:36:19,472 --> 01:36:21,463
You'll be all right.

764
01:36:27,347 --> 01:36:29,440
You gotta get out of here.

765
01:36:32,052 --> 01:36:34,043
I ain't running anymore.

766
01:36:39,693 --> 01:36:41,786
I gotta ask you something.

767
01:36:42,429 --> 01:36:43,555
Yeah?

768
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:48,357
You know I would have won that
race if you didn't cheat, right?

769
01:36:51,438 --> 01:36:53,372
You hit your head hard.

770
01:36:58,244 --> 01:37:00,144
Don't make me laugh.

771
01:37:10,824 --> 01:37:12,189
All rise.

772
01:37:17,464 --> 01:37:19,193
Please be seated.

773
01:37:23,436 --> 01:37:25,495
Please rise, Mr. Toretto.

774
01:37:27,874 --> 01:37:30,138
I've listened to the testimony

775
01:37:30,643 --> 01:37:32,804
and taken into special consideration

776
01:37:32,879 --> 01:37:36,872
Agent O'Conner's appeal of clemency
on behalf of Mr. Toretto.

777
01:37:37,851 --> 01:37:40,513
That his actions directly resulted
in the apprehension

778
01:37:40,587 --> 01:37:43,420
of known drug trafficker Arturo Braga.

779
01:37:44,958 --> 01:37:46,357
However,

780
01:37:47,627 --> 01:37:49,618
this judiciary finds that

781
01:37:49,696 --> 01:37:54,531
one right does not make up
for a lifetime worth of wrongs.

782
01:37:55,201 --> 01:37:56,930
And as such,

783
01:37:57,003 --> 01:38:01,997
I find that I am forced to level the
maximum sentence under California law.

784
01:38:04,444 --> 01:38:06,105
Dominic Toretto,

785
01:38:06,946 --> 01:38:10,939
you are hereby sentenced
to serve 25 years to life

786
01:38:11,017 --> 01:38:14,111
at the Lompoc maximum
security prison system

787
01:38:14,854 --> 01:38:17,652
without the possibility of early parole.

788
01:38:18,258 --> 01:38:20,089
This court is adjourned.
