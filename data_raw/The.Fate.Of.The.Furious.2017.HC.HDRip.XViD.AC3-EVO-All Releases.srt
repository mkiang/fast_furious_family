1
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:13,334
HAVANA, CUBA

2
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,592
<i>We swap in parts from Ford
Plymouths and Cadillac.</i>

3
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,519
<i>My grandfather bought it in 1957.</i>

4
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:23,023
<i>When he died it passed to my father.
Then my brother and now to me.</i>

5
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,299
<i>Look at this,
this is an engine from a boat.</i>

6
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:27,750
<i>- No way.
- Yeah!</i>

7
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:29,721
<i>Whatever it takes to keep it running!</i>

8
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:31,719
This is a cuban spirit.

9
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:34,889
<i>Your spirit, keep it up.
Never ever lose that.</i>

10
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:35,741
<i>Dom..</i>

11
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:38,616
<i>It's your cousin..
He's in trouble, come quickly!</i>

12
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:40,724
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

13
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:52,779
<i>Please don't do this,
Understand my problem.</i>

14
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,989
You know I can't make
living without my car.

15
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,043
Isn't my problem bro.

16
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,298
Dominic Toretto..
I heard about you.

17
00:02:59,103 --> 00:03:00,234
Welcome to my island.

18
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:02,243
Why he hooking up
my cousin's car?

19
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:06,591
In the morning, I gave it to him..
He can't pay.. I take the car.

20
00:03:06,783 --> 00:03:07,904
I just need a few more days.

21
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,574
Few more days isn't
part of the deal.

22
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:11,055
Come on..

23
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:13,350
You make a deal
you gotta live up to it.

24
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,299
You make a deal
You gonna live up to it.

25
00:03:16,974 --> 00:03:18,339
Gonna live up to it?

26
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:22,374
So you are one of those types..

27
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:25,988
You take everyone's ride and then
ship it back to the states.

28
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:28,450
<i>You should show your
people some respect.</i>

29
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:30,177
You watch your mouth.

30
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:33,398
Now you got a problem.

31
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,921
I'm gonna keep it about the cars.

32
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:40,068
<i>I am really scared.</i>

33
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:42,947
You want a car?
Get it the right way.

34
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:45,614
- How?
- Race war.

35
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:48,008
I already own it, bro.

36
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,315
Not that car.

37
00:03:51,942 --> 00:03:52,955
Mine.

38
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:57,143
Dom, his car is the
fastest car in the Island.

39
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:59,059
Do you know what he
has under the hood?

40
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,220
Do you know, it doesn't matter
what's under a hood?

41
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:05,333
The only thing that matters is
who's behind the wheel.

42
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,067
- You think so?
- I know so.

43
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,147
Then race his car.

44
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,771
We ain't racing a quarter mile here.

45
00:04:15,147 --> 00:04:16,799
We race the cuban mile.

46
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:19,195
Done!

47
00:04:34,055 --> 00:04:35,695
I appreciate you what
you're trying to do.

48
00:04:36,534 --> 00:04:39,003
My car is the slowest
car on the Island.

49
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:43,137
Was...!

50
00:04:43,372 --> 00:04:46,219
Pull the seats the doors
the battery..

51
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:48,358
It ain't the motor, take it off.

52
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:53,286
- Laughing gas?
- Nah, Fed. This is cuban NOS.

53
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:55,237
You guys are crazy.

54
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:58,801
- What are you doing?
- Warm as turbo.

55
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:01,428
Pull that back in line..
Hold on!

56
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:03,555
Old trick used to play.

57
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:05,492
In case of emergencies.

58
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:07,639
You know that's way too much
booze for that engine.

59
00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:11,331
- It's going to be fast.
- It's gonna be a bomb.

60
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:13,468
Only needs to go a mile.

61
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:42,522
<i>Are you ready for this, family?</i>

62
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,514
<i>This is Havana!</i>

63
00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:47,520
<i>Be fast!</i>

64
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:50,042
<i>Be safe!</i>

65
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:54,672
<i>But don't be last.
Racers ready...?</i>

66
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,327
<i>Go...!</i>

67
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:26,471
<i>Stop.</i>

68
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,849
That car belongs in the trash bro.

69
00:07:26,222 --> 00:07:28,814
- Where are we going?
- I don't know. Let's go.

70
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:45,941
- Go steer.
- Si.

71
00:08:04,575 --> 00:08:06,135
Adios, Toretto.

72
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:13,819
Ok, buster...
Let's see if this works.

73
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:22,991
That's impossible..

74
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:43,297
Look out.

75
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:39,027
A deal's a deal.

76
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:42,374
You own my car.

77
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:46,285
And you earn my respect.

78
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:01,993
Keep your car.

79
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,024
Your respect is
good enough for me.

80
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:11,914
Yo Cousin.

81
00:11:13,147 --> 00:11:14,409
Sorry 'bout your car,

82
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:22,685
Your's was too slow
for a Torreto anyway.

83
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:25,292
Your Impala.
Are you serious?

84
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:13,463
Look at that smile

85
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:15,250
I love it when you smile.

86
00:12:15,992 --> 00:12:17,090
Make me happy.

87
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:20,947
I think this place makes you happy.

88
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:24,326
It's like it speaks to you.

89
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:31,208
You remember that guy?
The Racer and his dad.

90
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:34,128
- The one with the boat engine.
- Yeah!

91
00:12:34,748 --> 00:12:36,248
- Yeah.
- Of course.

92
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:39,106
I was looking at them, and I..

93
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:44,292
And I couldn't help but too imagine
what you'd be like, if you were dad.

94
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:49,287
No, no, no...
I'm not pregnant.

95
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:54,201
Is that what you want?

96
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:56,965
It's not about what I want
or what you want..

97
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:00,661
It's about why
we haven't asked the question.

98
00:13:24,827 --> 00:13:26,301
<i>Can I help you with that?</i>

99
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,367
- What?
- You need a hand?

100
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,234
Yeah, I think I do.

101
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,538
Sounds like you're
not getting any fuel.

102
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:35,608
Yeah.

103
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:39,344
See if we can get
some power into it.

104
00:13:41,512 --> 00:13:43,220
What brings you to Cuba?

105
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:47,041
The same thing that brings
everyone else to Cuba.

106
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:50,230
Culture. People. Beauty.

107
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,325
What brings you to Cuba?

108
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:55,365
- Work!
- Must be casual Friday.

109
00:13:57,074 --> 00:13:58,865
How is that honeymoon going Dom?

110
00:14:04,214 --> 00:14:06,182
Your fuel relay is missing.

111
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:09,379
I know.

112
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:16,917
I'd love to play games.
Beaten the bests alone.

113
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:20,126
I'm kinda in a rush,
so if you got something to say...

114
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:22,395
Oh this is a very different game
that I can assure you.

115
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:24,387
This...?

116
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:27,662
There is something much greater
at work here.

117
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:30,308
This is fate.

118
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,336
- I choose to make my own fate.
- Not today.

119
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:36,887
This is the road you take
to your apartment every morning.

120
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,367
What else is different, Dom?
The Santiago's closed?

121
00:14:40,653 --> 00:14:42,929
Did you have to cross two blocks
to go get your cuban coffee?

122
00:14:42,953 --> 00:14:44,947
So, what is it?
Black, no sugar?

123
00:14:46,162 --> 00:14:50,160
Yeah.. I've put a lot of work
into getting you here in today.

124
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:52,399
Now that I'm here,
what do you want?

125
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:55,199
I want you to work for me.

126
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:57,004
Work for you?

127
00:14:57,367 --> 00:14:59,430
Well, I could have saved you
a lot of time then.

128
00:15:00,022 --> 00:15:01,562
See, I don't work for anyone.

129
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:03,887
You can't walk away from this Dom.

130
00:15:04,093 --> 00:15:06,589
We're gonna have this
conversation one way or the other.

131
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:10,217
See that's the funny
thing about fate.

132
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:11,687
It's cunning.

133
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:13,591
It can bring you beautiful things,

134
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:15,672
and it can also bring you
moments like this.

135
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:32,277
I will hear that you
want to work for me.

136
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:34,944
You're gonna betray your brothers,

137
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:37,179
abandon your code,
shatter your family.

138
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:38,393
See, your team..

139
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,556
Is about to go up against the
only thing they can't handle.

140
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:44,237
What's that?

141
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:46,837
You.

142
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:52,133
Oh, and Dom,
I wouldn't mention this to anyone.

143
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:03,338
They are gonna be hitting us
with everything they've got.

144
00:16:04,148 --> 00:16:06,272
So, we wanna engage
with maximum speed.

145
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:09,291
Neutralize the shooters
and then move on to our objective.

146
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,954
There are two things
I want you to keep in mind,

147
00:16:12,043 --> 00:16:13,043
Number one,

148
00:16:13,158 --> 00:16:14,558
I choose you for this squad

149
00:16:14,628 --> 00:16:18,174
because you are the most
fearsome warriors on the planet.

150
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:19,538
And number two,

151
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:22,915
You go out there, you do your job.
And you take 'em down.

152
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:25,585
Everyone...
And I mean everyone..

153
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:28,230
Manice and pedice at the mall.

154
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:29,607
Later on today.

155
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,021
I don't wanna play anymore.

156
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:33,851
Alright, let's go, girls.
Let's go, let's go.

157
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:36,100
- Final 2 minutes.
- Quite the cheering section.

158
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:43,127
Oh yeah. That's moms
they come out to sport the kids.

159
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:45,124
Except there seems to be more moms
than kids,

160
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,420
Way more like moms and..

161
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:53,294
Yeah, it's a big soccer job.
Let's go girls.

162
00:17:53,802 --> 00:17:55,267
So your intel was spot on...

163
00:17:55,862 --> 00:17:58,482
A democly 7 EMP weapon
that went missing in the gulf.

164
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:01,134
Arms dealer from the
Liberation front have it in Berlin.

165
00:18:01,378 --> 00:18:02,789
- Shit.
- This thing can wipe out..

166
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:04,953
An entire electrical grid
in a major city.

167
00:18:05,182 --> 00:18:07,344
No lights, no power,
instant stone age.

168
00:18:08,152 --> 00:18:08,952
Chloe, Maya...

169
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:10,313
You can't let her run
by you like that.

170
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:11,732
- Let's go, let's go.
- Hey, Hobbs.

171
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:13,396
This is a class 4 WMD.

172
00:18:13,596 --> 00:18:15,056
Do you have any idea what's
at stake here...?

173
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,388
Yes...! I know exactly what is
at stake here, okay?

174
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,548
If Pink Butterflies
beat my Red Dragon

175
00:18:19,618 --> 00:18:21,737
that means we lose the championship.

176
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,471
Which means I have 20 little girls
who are crying..

177
00:18:24,714 --> 00:18:25,835
And that's not a good thing.

178
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:28,626
Which then means I have to spend
a lot of time in ice cream shops

179
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:30,458
and lot of time in Tay-Tay concerts.

180
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,213
- Tay-Tay?
- Yep? Taylor Swift.

181
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:36,162
You gotta be shitting me
Get it together.

182
00:18:36,554 --> 00:18:37,554
Let's go girls.

183
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:38,635
We need you to do this,

184
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:41,761
Lot of lives are at stake.
I need to be clear here.

185
00:18:42,157 --> 00:18:45,147
US Government can not sanction
this operation in anyway.

186
00:18:45,217 --> 00:18:46,217
You're on your own.

187
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:48,602
This thing goes sideways
you don't just get burned,

188
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:50,206
you go to prison.

189
00:18:50,806 --> 00:18:52,566
And there's nothing we can do
to get you out.

190
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:55,167
Let me tell you something.

191
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:58,340
The only thing that I love
more than saving lives..

192
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:00,343
Is my daughter.

193
00:19:00,543 --> 00:19:03,302
So you don't shut up with this
government bullshit right now

194
00:19:03,347 --> 00:19:08,149
and start showing some team spirit
and respect for the Red Dragons.

195
00:19:08,953 --> 00:19:12,289
I'm gonna have all 20 of them lined
up kick you right in the Tay-Tay.

196
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,321
Go, Dragons!

197
00:19:17,563 --> 00:19:18,230
Say it again.

198
00:19:18,431 --> 00:19:20,786
- Go, Dragons!
- Good boy.

199
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:23,255
Go Dragons..
Go Dragons..

200
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:26,235
Go, he's open...
Go, Yup!

201
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:28,173
Yes!

202
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:31,206
That is my daughter right there!
Yes!

203
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:33,259
Ah, yes, come here.

204
00:19:34,348 --> 00:19:36,285
- Awesome.
- Nice job.

205
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,220
Daddy's gotta go to work?

206
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,384
Oh yeah,
daddy's gotta go to work.

207
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,354
Now, you gonna need to get a team
that you can trust.

208
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,694
Oh, I already got one.

209
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:14,146
- Hey, Dom.
- Hey, Hobbs.

210
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,684
We got a job in Berlin,
and I need a favor, brother.

211
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:19,096
No problem.

212
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:20,826
I grab the team and
meet you in Berlin.

213
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:23,657
Thanks man.
I'll see you soon.

214
00:20:50,398 --> 00:20:52,781
You were only to supposed
to create a diversion, Roman.

215
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:54,095
That was a diversion.

216
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:55,982
How many of the damn explosives
did you use?

217
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:58,325
I do not know, Tez.
All of it?

218
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,428
- Wait, all of it?
- Roman, Jesus!

219
00:21:00,628 --> 00:21:03,362
- Christ!
- You have more of your fan club ahead.

220
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:10,346
They're still on us.

221
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,836
These guys are taking this personal.

222
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:15,941
Roman, we just blown up their
facility and stole their EMP.

223
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:17,794
Other than your doctor's cold fingers,

224
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:20,070
I'd say it's about as
personal as it can get.

225
00:21:20,601 --> 00:21:22,318
- Phase 2.
- Phase 2?

226
00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:24,445
So you just gonna keep
that to yourself?

227
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:25,709
What happen to Phase 1?

228
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:26,909
What about that part?

229
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,390
Yeah, remember the airplane?

230
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,375
Everyone drove their
cars out but you.

231
00:21:30,475 --> 00:21:32,214
I told you my engine seized up.

232
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:33,352
It's your balls that seized up?

233
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,656
Just follow my lead, okay?

234
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:38,388
And Roman, whatever you do.
Don't think.

235
00:21:39,187 --> 00:21:40,389
Tez, drop it.

236
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:41,889
Bomb's away.

237
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:45,328
Split now!

238
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:50,564
Holy shit!

239
00:21:51,263 --> 00:21:52,432
<i>Look out...!</i>

240
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,707
- Great plan Tez.
- Just so you know.

241
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:09,935
You miss some.

242
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:12,312
I'll just wait for it.

243
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,988
Oh... Shit!

244
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:29,434
I hate you, Tez!

245
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:32,775
Got your ass.

246
00:22:38,978 --> 00:22:39,978
You good?

247
00:22:42,265 --> 00:22:44,232
I'll see you when it's done.

248
00:22:47,956 --> 00:22:49,035
Alright. Great job, team.

249
00:22:49,105 --> 00:22:51,004
Let's break up and meet
me at the safe house.

250
00:23:05,795 --> 00:23:07,114
Hell of a job, brother.

251
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,160
When we can get back
to the base. Beers on me.

252
00:23:33,274 --> 00:23:35,144
You lost your god damn mind,
Toretto!

253
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:40,341
Toretto you put hands on that thing,

254
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:43,157
you're gonna have the whole world
coming for you including me.

255
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,366
I don't know what you're doing

256
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:51,012
but you better think
about this, Toretto.

257
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:54,245
It ain't too late to stop this.

258
00:24:06,352 --> 00:24:07,352
It is now.

259
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:15,152
That some bitch just crossed us..

260
00:24:15,177 --> 00:24:15,714
What?

261
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:17,247
Wait a second, what
are you talking about?

262
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:19,599
- Dom took the EMP.
- Bullshit.

263
00:24:20,913 --> 00:24:21,638
Where are you?

264
00:24:21,778 --> 00:24:23,258
It's too late for me.
Get out of here.

265
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,157
Saw that look in his eyes.

266
00:24:25,182 --> 00:24:27,710
I've seen that look before.

267
00:24:27,735 --> 00:24:29,865
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.

268
00:25:31,923 --> 00:25:33,817
Alright, I got his phone records, y'all.

269
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,416
It's a whole bunch of calls
to untraceable numbers.

270
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,783
Burner phone, right?

271
00:25:37,808 --> 00:25:38,874
Nah. Scrambled.

272
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,484
Same number but they got
some sort of micro-router..

273
00:25:41,554 --> 00:25:43,959
To bury the signal path
which means Dom is clearly..

274
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,374
Communicating with somebody
that is above our pay grade.

275
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:48,498
Look,
I do not know Dom as well as you,

276
00:25:48,568 --> 00:25:50,393
but if we just look at the facts.

277
00:25:50,852 --> 00:25:53,125
Dom's been having highly encrypted

278
00:25:53,195 --> 00:25:55,935
conversation with some
mysterious person.

279
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:58,597
He took out Hobbs.

280
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:01,387
He stole the EMP,
now he's disappeared.

281
00:26:01,412 --> 00:26:02,575
So what're you saying?

282
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,574
Maybe we should
consider the fact that..

283
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:05,817
Hobb's right.

284
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:08,323
Dom did go rogue.

285
00:26:09,495 --> 00:26:11,589
- Letty.
- Before you judge the man,

286
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:15,930
Remember you're breathing
now because he saved your life.

287
00:26:23,602 --> 00:26:25,661
You just gonna let her
bump your shoulder like that

288
00:26:26,922 --> 00:26:29,830
I'm just saying it out..
That was a little aggressive.

289
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:33,757
What're you gonna do.
Email her?

290
00:26:36,658 --> 00:26:37,658
<i>Chick..</i>

291
00:26:48,726 --> 00:26:49,852
No no, wait, fellas.

292
00:26:51,183 --> 00:26:52,238
Thank you.

293
00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:54,724
Well, this is an exciting new look.

294
00:26:54,794 --> 00:26:57,730
That's a little tight on
the crotch as always.

295
00:26:58,164 --> 00:27:00,256
What boyband bus did she fallen off?

296
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:02,269
My new junior associate.

297
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:04,273
He's working with me on this.
All yours.

298
00:27:04,298 --> 00:27:04,945
Mr Nobody and I

299
00:27:05,015 --> 00:27:07,258
have been given the authority
to get you out of this.

300
00:27:07,283 --> 00:27:10,412
All you have to do is agree
to the terms and you're free.

301
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,460
Restraining wills, talking about,
what terms?

302
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,968
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.

303
00:27:15,993 --> 00:27:17,863
Treason,
international espionage.

304
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,949
Massive destruction
of civic property.

305
00:27:19,974 --> 00:27:21,849
You do that, we close the case.

306
00:27:22,056 --> 00:27:22,560
And?

307
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:25,521
And the DSS blacklist.
Sure Germany loves that.

308
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:27,467
Officially you'll be a criminal.

309
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:28,368
Woah, woah, woah.

310
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,166
You need to work on
your delivery alright.

311
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:31,366
Unofficially.

312
00:27:33,183 --> 00:27:36,153
You're off the books.
Come work with me.

313
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,930
- I'm not a criminal.
- Luke Come on. Labels.

314
00:27:40,634 --> 00:27:42,465
There is no confession.

315
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,106
There are no back room deals.

316
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:46,435
Got myself into this,
I'm gonna get myself out of it.

317
00:27:46,461 --> 00:27:47,146
You know that.

318
00:27:47,216 --> 00:27:49,123
I do and that's
what I told them.

319
00:27:49,148 --> 00:27:50,812
Well, there you have it.

320
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:54,081
Good luck in the course, man!

321
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:57,650
What about your daughter?

322
00:27:59,686 --> 00:28:01,606
You know, if you're not
gonna do it your country,

323
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:03,462
at least do it for your kid.

324
00:28:03,904 --> 00:28:05,365
Big mistake kid.

325
00:28:07,365 --> 00:28:09,091
Hold on. Look, look.

326
00:28:09,116 --> 00:28:10,837
He's still working from the manual.

327
00:28:10,907 --> 00:28:13,121
I mean, he doesn't even
really know the rules.

328
00:28:13,821 --> 00:28:15,790
Oh come on.
Give him a break.

329
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,090
Get a break.

330
00:28:17,566 --> 00:28:18,658
Luke?

331
00:28:21,603 --> 00:28:23,572
I appreciate that.

332
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:26,863
- It's good to see you, Nobody.
- You too.

333
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:30,218
Rule No.1,

334
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:33,156
know your audience.

335
00:28:33,356 --> 00:28:35,479
I gave you your shot,
you shit the bed.

336
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:37,724
Now I'm gonna show you
how to get this done.

337
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,626
- You're dead cop!
- Dead!

338
00:28:52,388 --> 00:28:54,093
Well, well, well...

339
00:28:54,464 --> 00:28:57,772
Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that?

340
00:28:59,093 --> 00:29:00,921
The band cop got it's day.

341
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,785
You know,
that color looks good on you.

342
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:18,316
Yeah. Look a whole hell of a lot better
with your blood on it.

343
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,345
Yeah. Good luck with that, Hercules.

344
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:22,490
Gone bad. Huh?

345
00:29:23,243 --> 00:29:24,403
Such a cliche.

346
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,163
Ah well.
Welcome to the club.

347
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,621
I wouldn't get that twisted son.

348
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:31,857
We ain't in no club.
We got nothing in common.

349
00:29:31,927 --> 00:29:33,791
And unlike you,
I ain't gonna be here long.

350
00:29:33,991 --> 00:29:35,151
You bring the shovel did you?

351
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:38,003
Cause it's 38 feet of
steel and concrete.

352
00:29:38,297 --> 00:29:40,322
What's up big dog?

353
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:43,101
Better get to dig in.

354
00:29:45,306 --> 00:29:46,315
You wanker.

355
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:08,687
Move..

356
00:30:09,617 --> 00:30:10,617
Say that again.

357
00:30:11,713 --> 00:30:15,611
If I say it again,
It will be to acorpse.

358
00:30:18,662 --> 00:30:19,972
I'm going to enjoy this.

359
00:30:20,172 --> 00:30:21,563
Welcome back, Dom.

360
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:23,254
Nice job out there.

361
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:26,122
Excited about tonight?

362
00:30:27,823 --> 00:30:28,963
You're going on this?

363
00:30:33,937 --> 00:30:35,068
You're with me Dom.

364
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:47,137
- Showing me your shoe collection?
- Yup.

365
00:30:51,448 --> 00:30:53,016
A pair for every occasion.

366
00:30:53,216 --> 00:30:56,148
There's enough guns here to
outfit a small army. Huh?

367
00:30:56,348 --> 00:30:58,617
Oh this is just the
tip of the iceberg.

368
00:31:02,022 --> 00:31:03,555
You know what I like about you, Dom.

369
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:04,940
You're a genuine outlaw.

370
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,524
I mean, you're a man who
lives by his own rules.

371
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:11,559
Which was surprising because when I
saw you in Cuba, I heard about a

372
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,315
guy who almost killed
you with a motorcycle and

373
00:31:14,388 --> 00:31:16,633
you.. let him keep his car?

374
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,722
- Oh, that confused you?
- Hmm.

375
00:31:21,668 --> 00:31:23,658
Of course I could've
taken his car.

376
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,503
But it's about something bigger.

377
00:31:26,573 --> 00:31:27,695
This way...

378
00:31:29,907 --> 00:31:31,167
I changed them.

379
00:31:31,406 --> 00:31:32,799
That's not your responsibility.

380
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:34,264
- That's who I am.
- Is it?

381
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:38,540
Let me ask you something Dom,
what's the best thing in your life?

382
00:31:39,513 --> 00:31:41,571
- Family.
- No, it's not.

383
00:31:43,281 --> 00:31:44,748
But if you're being honest?

384
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:47,331
It's the 10 seconds between

385
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,485
start and finish, when you're not
thinking about anything.

386
00:31:50,585 --> 00:31:54,543
No family,
not obligations, just you.

387
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:56,749
Being free.

388
00:32:01,873 --> 00:32:04,683
I gotta tell you.
This whole saving the world...

389
00:32:04,753 --> 00:32:07,563
Robin Hood nonsense
you've been doing recently...

390
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:10,530
It's bullshit. It's not you.

391
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:17,569
Be who you are.

392
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,096
Why live only a quarter
mile at a time,

393
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:22,695
when you can live your
whole life that way?

394
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:38,514
See all those blow that muscles
will give you.

395
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:40,549
All show and no..

396
00:32:54,493 --> 00:32:55,987
Well I got plenty of goal.

397
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,481
You must have misplaced that.

398
00:32:57,551 --> 00:33:00,113
When I kicked your ass up in
down that office of yours.

399
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:01,555
Yeah.

400
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,015
Just like you Brits,
rewriting History, huh?

401
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:07,500
All I know. It was not
me who was thrown out

402
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,700
of a 4 storey window.

403
00:33:08,728 --> 00:33:11,669
Jumped.
I jumped out of a 4 storey window.

404
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:13,370
Saving my partner's life.

405
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,717
Because where I'm from,

406
00:33:14,787 --> 00:33:16,732
we don't settle fight
by throwing bombs.

407
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:18,612
Well, that's funny, because
where I'm from,

408
00:33:18,782 --> 00:33:21,276
we don't need women
to run to our rescue.

409
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:24,534
I mean, do you really believe you
could stand in front of me?

410
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,706
And beat me in a straight up
old fashioned fist fight?

411
00:33:27,776 --> 00:33:30,682
Let me tell you something.
Me and you...

412
00:33:30,752 --> 00:33:33,615
One on one, no one else around.

413
00:33:34,484 --> 00:33:38,647
I will beat your ass
like a Cherokee drum.

414
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:42,929
Maybe one day we will find that out.

415
00:33:43,077 --> 00:33:45,150
Oh, you better hope
that day never comes.

416
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:56,496
I said no, Mr. Nobody.

417
00:33:56,696 --> 00:33:58,529
I'm not leaving this cell.

418
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:00,533
I'll get out my way.

419
00:34:01,535 --> 00:34:02,535
The right way.

420
00:34:08,202 --> 00:34:10,619
- Get back to your cell.
- It's just a malfunction.

421
00:34:10,819 --> 00:34:12,541
- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.

422
00:34:25,516 --> 00:34:27,484
Don't let him get away.

423
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:01,088
<i>Hobbs!</i>

424
00:35:02,474 --> 00:35:04,464
I've been waiting a
long time for this.

425
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:06,668
Keep waiting bitch!

426
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:14,512
Rubber bullets, big mistake.

427
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:38,525
Ah, took longer than I expected.

428
00:36:41,168 --> 00:36:42,194
- 2 questions.
- Yeah.

429
00:36:42,294 --> 00:36:44,192
- My daughter?
- With your sister.

430
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:48,162
- Toretto?
- That's interesting you ask.

431
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:51,960
This is my new base,
welcome to Nowhere.

432
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:54,311
Nice little stair for you.

433
00:36:55,811 --> 00:36:57,025
Listen, It's something I don't wanna
talk to you about...

434
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,794
Hey, listen guys. Thanks..

435
00:36:58,994 --> 00:37:00,902
Whoa, whoa, what handcuff.
What is this?

436
00:37:01,102 --> 00:37:02,488
It's called the abuse of power.

437
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,269
You told me to round 'em up.

438
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:05,850
I told you that...
hand..

439
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,983
Cut 'em loose.
Oh man, this is embarrassing.

440
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:11,051
I'm sorry guys, what do I have?

441
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:13,121
This is how you treat old friends?

442
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:13,820
Friend?

443
00:37:13,985 --> 00:37:16,386
We don't even really know
who the hell this guys is.

444
00:37:16,586 --> 00:37:18,987
It does not matter who I am,
Tez I'm like Nobody ok?

445
00:37:19,187 --> 00:37:19,883
Nobody, then who is he?

446
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:21,826
He's nothing
he's like less than me.

447
00:37:22,026 --> 00:37:24,995
Clearly we're getting nowhere,
with nobody.

448
00:37:25,695 --> 00:37:28,011
I've been in here for 4 hours,
my ribs are sore.

449
00:37:28,211 --> 00:37:31,028
I don't know about y'all,
but I'm out.

450
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:34,048
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- What?

451
00:37:34,248 --> 00:37:35,995
Well,
thanks to your bust Berlin job.

452
00:37:36,195 --> 00:37:39,033
You all made interpol's
top 10 most wanted list.

453
00:37:39,233 --> 00:37:42,006
Top 10? Uh-huh.
That's alright.

454
00:37:42,206 --> 00:37:44,007
Well, not you.

455
00:37:44,241 --> 00:37:44,744
What do you mean?

456
00:37:44,814 --> 00:37:46,350
You just missed the cut,
you're number 11.

457
00:37:46,374 --> 00:37:48,773
- So.
- I missed it?

458
00:37:48,973 --> 00:37:50,972
- Yeah.
- That's impossible.

459
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:53,170
What number did they come in at?

460
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,181
Six, eight, nine...

461
00:37:56,381 --> 00:37:57,381
Ten.

462
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:01,433
She's Ten? That's impossible,
there is no way she's at 10.

463
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:03,085
Oh, She's definitely at 10.

464
00:38:04,188 --> 00:38:06,386
How about we focus
on someone who

465
00:38:06,443 --> 00:38:08,161
we're not gonna find out
in anybody's list?

466
00:38:08,361 --> 00:38:10,786
We are awaiting hard
confirmation, but...

467
00:38:10,986 --> 00:38:14,926
I believe that's the cyber
terrorist known as Cipher.

468
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,187
Wait, no, Cipher's an organization.

469
00:38:17,387 --> 00:38:18,407
Not a person.

470
00:38:18,607 --> 00:38:19,796
Not according to our sources.

471
00:38:19,996 --> 00:38:22,379
- What does she want?
- I don't know.

472
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:24,762
Cipher is like a digital active God.

473
00:38:24,962 --> 00:38:28,992
They, she, can manipulate
world systems under shadows.

474
00:38:29,092 --> 00:38:30,252
Anything that can be hacked..

475
00:38:30,604 --> 00:38:31,771
And here is the kicker.

476
00:38:31,971 --> 00:38:33,898
You will never find her
linked to any other.

477
00:38:34,098 --> 00:38:37,429
Her digital identity is scrubbed
every few seconds worldwide.

478
00:38:37,738 --> 00:38:39,175
So basically, she
is the boogeyman.

479
00:38:39,245 --> 00:38:40,004
Yeah, she is.

480
00:38:40,204 --> 00:38:43,024
One of the hottest boogeyman
I have ever seen, I mean...

481
00:38:43,094 --> 00:38:46,013
If y'all know her, tell her
to get extra boy.

482
00:38:47,448 --> 00:38:49,081
- What are you, 12?
- That was my scene.

483
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:50,717
Let's just say.

484
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:52,797
People are scared of the
hacker group Anonymous.

485
00:38:53,117 --> 00:38:54,844
But even anonymous
won't mess with her.

486
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:57,032
What the hell does any of this
have to do with us?

487
00:38:57,213 --> 00:38:58,766
Probably nothing, Letty.
But...

488
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,528
I do find it interesting,
apparently for some reason.

489
00:39:01,701 --> 00:39:03,760
She's now working with this guy.

490
00:39:19,202 --> 00:39:23,102
He's already delivered a fully
operational EMP into her hands.

491
00:39:23,204 --> 00:39:24,086
Detonate that,

492
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:27,368
they can turn any city in
the world into a war zone.

493
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,987
So then what is it that
you're suggesting?

494
00:39:30,012 --> 00:39:31,377
Maybe we find Dom huh?

495
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,619
Well, first let's catch him
and then figure out

496
00:39:33,644 --> 00:39:36,570
- why he's turned.
- So y'all want us...

497
00:39:36,595 --> 00:39:37,703
To track Dom.

498
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,792
And I know Roman,
it's kinda a big job.

499
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,084
- It's impossible.
- Which is why...

500
00:39:44,109 --> 00:39:46,271
I'm bringing in an
extra pair of hands.

501
00:39:52,008 --> 00:39:54,814
Ah. My day just got a
whole hell of a lot better.

502
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,001
Mr. Nobody you want to tell me
why you just put me in a room

503
00:39:57,025 --> 00:40:00,663
with this teen crumpeting criminal,
some bitch.

504
00:40:00,688 --> 00:40:02,854
You got a big mouth
on a small head.

505
00:40:02,879 --> 00:40:05,115
Coming from prisoner 6753.

506
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,185
Don't think we've forgotten
everything that you've done.

507
00:40:07,209 --> 00:40:09,878
We're not...
teaming up with this guy.

508
00:40:09,903 --> 00:40:10,909
Let's get one thing clear.

509
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:14,903
I ain't on your team.
I don't care about you, you crew...

510
00:40:14,928 --> 00:40:17,618
Your little family.
I'm here for Cipher.

511
00:40:17,743 --> 00:40:19,667
You gonna do apply for a job,
Head-asshole?

512
00:40:19,692 --> 00:40:21,053
You don't think that tight t-shirt

513
00:40:21,061 --> 00:40:22,703
is cutting off the
circulation to your brain.

514
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,967
You should get bigger size.

515
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,802
Cipher came to me first.

516
00:40:26,827 --> 00:40:28,223
Wanted me to steal
Nightshade for her.

517
00:40:28,247 --> 00:40:29,899
When I said no,
she went off to my brother.

518
00:40:29,923 --> 00:40:30,886
Oh Yes.

519
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:33,276
Brother Owen who
could forget him?

520
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:35,805
Former hell-raiser
and current guest,

521
00:40:36,157 --> 00:40:39,133
at a nasty little black site prison.

522
00:40:39,181 --> 00:40:41,216
Cipher corrupted him
left him for dead.

523
00:40:41,246 --> 00:40:42,686
So if I get a shot to take her down,

524
00:40:42,712 --> 00:40:44,151
believe me, flicks
I'm taking it.

525
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:45,515
You're taking my boot
right up your ass.

526
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:48,700
Guys, guys, guys. The fastest way
to find Cipher is through Toretto.

527
00:40:48,725 --> 00:40:51,043
Now aside from myself,
there's only two men in the world,

528
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:52,690
that have ever managed
to actually track him..

529
00:40:52,714 --> 00:40:54,666
Down with any success.
And guess what.

530
00:40:54,691 --> 00:40:57,719
They're both standing in front
of me right now. So like it or not,

531
00:40:57,744 --> 00:40:59,881
you two are gonna work together.

532
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,844
You got that?

533
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,088
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

534
00:41:07,186 --> 00:41:08,941
Am I the only one seeing this?

535
00:41:09,327 --> 00:41:10,775
Oh, this oughtta be good.

536
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:17,400
Use God's eye.
We put our lives on the line..

537
00:41:17,425 --> 00:41:20,301
Running around the world
trying to figure this thing out.

538
00:41:20,326 --> 00:41:23,879
It can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.

539
00:41:23,904 --> 00:41:26,931
Roman, that is a great idea.

540
00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:30,039
Did you hear that? Great idea.

541
00:41:30,884 --> 00:41:33,909
- And no, no! No pointing out.
- Mr. Nobody.

542
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:35,112
Let's fire it up.. huh?

543
00:41:45,926 --> 00:41:47,154
Got him.
He's in London.

544
00:41:53,532 --> 00:41:56,964
Wait, we have got a
2nd match in Hong Kong.

545
00:41:57,301 --> 00:42:00,935
- Bejing and Seole.
- And Tokyo.

546
00:42:02,904 --> 00:42:05,872
And just about every other
major city on the planet.

547
00:42:06,072 --> 00:42:08,799
And so...
God's eye was where we start.

548
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:12,708
Cipher's already created an evasion
that masked her location by..

549
00:42:12,907 --> 00:42:15,052
Pinging random spots
all over the globe.

550
00:42:15,122 --> 00:42:16,936
But it was a good thought Roman.

551
00:42:18,047 --> 00:42:19,840
So she's made my
programme obsolete.

552
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,037
And that Ramsey..

553
00:42:21,237 --> 00:42:23,948
- Is why are you here.
- See, simple solutions...

554
00:42:24,148 --> 00:42:25,388
aren't gonna cut it here slick.

555
00:42:27,553 --> 00:42:29,513
Why are you looking at me
when you're saying that?

556
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:30,652
Wait a second, wait, wait.

557
00:42:30,752 --> 00:42:32,550
Simple solutions might just cut it.

558
00:42:32,826 --> 00:42:35,727
In order for God's eyes to
give up all this false pings,

559
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:37,960
Means they have to
be using a free relay.

560
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,030
Watch these two.

561
00:42:39,217 --> 00:42:41,111
Which means it has a decaying
sync quantanizer.

562
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:42,692
Which we can reverse.

563
00:42:42,892 --> 00:42:45,203
And track it back to
the originating source

564
00:42:45,272 --> 00:42:46,922
and find Dom's true location.

565
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:49,705
Telling you, they got skills.

566
00:42:49,905 --> 00:42:50,905
That was my idea.

567
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:53,113
That's what I was saying,
remember in there?

568
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,662
Alright.
Let's try this.

569
00:43:05,911 --> 00:43:06,612
It's working..

570
00:43:06,899 --> 00:43:09,936
Time you wanna take your manual
and start organizing first response...

571
00:43:10,914 --> 00:43:12,148
Let's get a hold of
our internatio...

572
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,679
He's still..

573
00:43:13,879 --> 00:43:15,649
Yes, like first baby shit.

574
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:17,186
Yes, we've tried those location...

575
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,041
wanna mobilize.

576
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:25,912
Let's get a hold of a, better asshole.
No one respects you, over.

577
00:43:26,012 --> 00:43:27,012
Get away from me.

578
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:29,858
Alright they are not in China..

579
00:43:30,927 --> 00:43:31,927
Or Russia.

580
00:43:33,265 --> 00:43:34,265
Europe's clear.

581
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,954
But this one's not going away.

582
00:43:39,465 --> 00:43:40,898
This is interesting.

583
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:43,333
Why?

584
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:46,068
Because that's here.

585
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:30,262
Did you all enjoy that?
Next generation concussion grenade.

586
00:44:30,554 --> 00:44:32,421
It scrambles your senses.

587
00:44:33,691 --> 00:44:35,329
Don't worry,
It'll wear off in an hour.

588
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:37,528
Probably.

589
00:44:38,335 --> 00:44:41,428
Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.

590
00:44:43,371 --> 00:44:46,238
Look at this,
bodies not even cold Dom.

591
00:44:46,438 --> 00:44:49,306
Your family's already replacing you.

592
00:44:50,476 --> 00:44:53,244
You chose the loosing team.

593
00:44:53,444 --> 00:44:56,479
I guess your brother
is smarter than you.

594
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:33,301
Smart move embedding God's eye
into the mainframe.

595
00:45:33,394 --> 00:45:34,451
Irritating to make me have to come

596
00:45:34,475 --> 00:45:36,590
all the way down here to get it, but.

597
00:45:39,807 --> 00:45:40,807
Let's go.

598
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:48,938
Dom!

599
00:45:57,818 --> 00:46:00,556
You're gonna turn
your back on family?

600
00:46:00,626 --> 00:46:01,810
Just like that?

601
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:38,003
Let's go.

602
00:47:11,898 --> 00:47:13,431
You okay?

603
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,368
That wasn't him.

604
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:23,497
I don't know what she's got on him.

605
00:47:24,406 --> 00:47:26,397
But that wasn't Dom.

606
00:47:27,441 --> 00:47:30,307
- Bryan would know what to do.
- No.

607
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:36,507
We can't bring Bryan
and Mia into this.

608
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,305
We agreed on that.

609
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:42,444
I know.

610
00:47:50,135 --> 00:47:51,727
Back there was that for her,

611
00:47:52,096 --> 00:47:54,522
for me, or you?

612
00:47:55,777 --> 00:47:58,176
Or was it either necessary?

613
00:47:59,149 --> 00:48:00,309
Necessary?

614
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:04,315
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.

615
00:48:05,192 --> 00:48:07,197
I simply made one but so did you.

616
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:09,974
You could have stopped me,
but you chose not to do.

617
00:48:10,074 --> 00:48:12,260
I wonder what Letty
thought about that.

618
00:48:14,406 --> 00:48:17,336
The problem of putting your foot
on a Tiger's neck...

619
00:48:17,351 --> 00:48:18,986
is you can never let it up.

620
00:48:19,214 --> 00:48:22,944
I think I need to remind you
why you chose to be here.

621
00:48:58,674 --> 00:49:00,171
Dom.

622
00:49:07,187 --> 00:49:09,179
Sorry.

623
00:49:11,126 --> 00:49:13,186
You shoudn't have come.

624
00:49:13,262 --> 00:49:15,161
Nothing's gonna get me away.

625
00:49:15,361 --> 00:49:17,231
Now she has the three of us.

626
00:49:23,678 --> 00:49:25,347
You wanna see him?

627
00:49:29,787 --> 00:49:30,805
See papa.

628
00:49:38,735 --> 00:49:40,336
Papa.

629
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:52,212
When I realized I was pregnant.

630
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,383
You had just find out
Letty was alive.

631
00:49:56,228 --> 00:49:59,256
So I decided when Letty and you
go back from your honeymoon.

632
00:49:59,367 --> 00:50:01,359
I was going to tell you.

633
00:50:03,842 --> 00:50:06,142
And then she took us
before I had the chance.

634
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,427
I call him Michaels.

635
00:50:19,264 --> 00:50:21,324
That his middle name.

636
00:50:22,268 --> 00:50:25,296
I thought his father should
give him first name.

637
00:50:35,588 --> 00:50:37,580
I'm sorry, Dom.

638
00:50:38,193 --> 00:50:40,562
There is nothing to be sorry for.

639
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:44,727
Whatever happens...

640
00:50:46,605 --> 00:50:48,665
Just save our son.

641
00:50:52,181 --> 00:50:53,776
Your son.

642
00:51:08,642 --> 00:51:11,141
-

643
00:51:14,715 --> 00:51:15,716
Good visit?

644
00:51:18,754 --> 00:51:20,849
I know. I know what
you're thinking.

645
00:51:22,861 --> 00:51:24,741
I just let the guards go,

646
00:51:24,811 --> 00:51:27,171
so there is only two opponents
in the room.

647
00:51:27,371 --> 00:51:30,862
Rhodes has the gun, so you'll
take him out first, I know you.

648
00:51:31,808 --> 00:51:33,835
And then you're thinking.

649
00:51:33,878 --> 00:51:36,384
Elena is a cop,
maybe the two of you

650
00:51:36,454 --> 00:51:38,613
can fight your way out of here.

651
00:51:38,652 --> 00:51:40,814
So much to think about.

652
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,725
Let me make it easier for you.

653
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:56,836
Do with it as you wish.

654
00:52:04,825 --> 00:52:07,660
Have you heard of choice theory Dom?

655
00:52:07,663 --> 00:52:09,043
There's a bunch of axiems

656
00:52:09,113 --> 00:52:11,726
but only two you really need
to concern yourself with,

657
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:12,769
One.

658
00:52:12,968 --> 00:52:16,284
The only person's behavior
we can control is our own.

659
00:52:16,744 --> 00:52:20,246
And two, the only thing we
can truly give another person

660
00:52:20,316 --> 00:52:22,819
is information, so let me
give you some.

661
00:52:23,922 --> 00:52:26,374
You see this cameras in here?

662
00:52:27,193 --> 00:52:28,461
The moment you make a move,

663
00:52:28,656 --> 00:52:30,475
highly paid men with weapons,

664
00:52:30,675 --> 00:52:32,075
will make there way into this room.

665
00:52:32,368 --> 00:52:35,662
With one very...
specific instruction.

666
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,708
It's not to save me.

667
00:52:39,345 --> 00:52:41,813
It's to kill your son.

668
00:52:42,683 --> 00:52:44,158
And that's a lot of bullets.

669
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:47,656
And it only takes one
for you to loose everything.

670
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,529
So, I have to ask you, because...

671
00:52:49,894 --> 00:52:53,889
I know family is so
important to you.

672
00:52:56,672 --> 00:52:59,642
Is that really a choice
you wanna make?

673
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:04,875
Because I'm ready as you are.

674
00:53:08,723 --> 00:53:11,694
I pull this trigger, and
God knows I wanna..

675
00:53:12,729 --> 00:53:14,926
I'll kill everyone on this plane...

676
00:53:15,667 --> 00:53:17,693
I still couldn't get in there.

677
00:53:18,406 --> 00:53:21,676
Cause you here
manipulate this system.

678
00:53:22,244 --> 00:53:23,900
Since I'm alone!

679
00:53:26,718 --> 00:53:28,846
I got no choice!

680
00:53:37,701 --> 00:53:39,761
I don't think so.

681
00:54:10,752 --> 00:54:12,846
You want to see the old Dom?

682
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:16,790
Watch.

683
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:36,870
Damn it..

684
00:54:37,545 --> 00:54:39,572
She wiped it off.
Took God's eye.

685
00:54:40,803 --> 00:54:43,603
That was the one thing
we could use to find him.

686
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:44,777
We lost everything.

687
00:54:47,089 --> 00:54:51,405
- Yeah, princess?
- Find it to rail.

688
00:54:51,605 --> 00:54:53,166
But I've got
couple of minutes to spare.

689
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:56,758
If you want me to send
you to the hospital again.

690
00:54:57,464 --> 00:54:59,496
- Yo Rules!
- First off,

691
00:54:59,506 --> 00:55:01,504
- That's not my name.
- Little nobody.

692
00:55:01,513 --> 00:55:03,432
- Don't call me that.
- Oh that's definitely stinky.

693
00:55:03,456 --> 00:55:05,799
Great do me a favor, and tell
your majesty over there,

694
00:55:05,868 --> 00:55:08,622
that we're gonna find Toretto.
We find Toretto together as a team.

695
00:55:08,943 --> 00:55:10,340
When this is all over,
you have me to

696
00:55:10,364 --> 00:55:12,425
slap that whickest biscuit
right off his face.

697
00:55:12,652 --> 00:55:14,852
Wait a minute, guys. I think
Decker's actually onto something.

698
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:16,338
How do you think
Dom and Cipher got

699
00:55:16,339 --> 00:55:18,228
into the country
without us knowing?

700
00:55:19,257 --> 00:55:21,255
- Ghost flights.
- That untraceable aircraft

701
00:55:21,298 --> 00:55:23,324
it was all internet
conspiracy stuff.

702
00:55:23,393 --> 00:55:24,393
It's not.

703
00:55:24,425 --> 00:55:26,955
Satellites and radar grids...

704
00:55:26,993 --> 00:55:28,991
All across the globe shift.

705
00:55:29,396 --> 00:55:32,917
Like an ocean. And they've got
channels that open and close.

706
00:55:32,952 --> 00:55:35,051
And theoretically, if you
know the right people who...

707
00:55:35,058 --> 00:55:36,069
Know the right patterns.

708
00:55:36,112 --> 00:55:38,332
You can fly right through
the blind's box...

709
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:39,499
can't be intercepted.

710
00:55:39,696 --> 00:55:41,768
So you know where Dom is headed?

711
00:55:42,478 --> 00:55:44,759
Yeah, New York.

712
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:48,470
You see there Luke..

713
00:55:48,521 --> 00:55:50,758
You guys...
are gonna get along just great.

714
00:55:50,793 --> 00:55:53,846
Which proves, rule number two,
you never lose everything.

715
00:55:54,613 --> 00:55:55,837
Fire up the chopper.

716
00:55:56,611 --> 00:55:58,551
Guys, have a bowl
and a Big Apple.

717
00:56:22,623 --> 00:56:24,644
Are we travelling like this again?

718
00:56:24,688 --> 00:56:27,741
Because Dom took God's Eye,
so we need to stay off the grid.

719
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:29,665
But like this?

720
00:56:34,382 --> 00:56:36,533
Look here man.
Before I throw up in my mouth...

721
00:56:36,732 --> 00:56:38,988
Let me ask you
what are we doing here?

722
00:56:39,005 --> 00:56:40,764
That's a good question, Roman.

723
00:56:42,202 --> 00:56:43,693
Let me show you.

724
00:56:47,595 --> 00:56:50,088
Welcome to our new
base of operations.

725
00:56:50,192 --> 00:56:53,212
Now seriously,
what is this place?

726
00:56:53,555 --> 00:56:56,117
This... is heaven.

727
00:57:01,946 --> 00:57:05,105
The agency garage.
We call it the toy shop.

728
00:57:12,435 --> 00:57:14,191
This is where we house every vehicles

729
00:57:14,261 --> 00:57:16,163
seized from drug
dealers of East coast.

730
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:18,326
Now. Mr nobody said..

731
00:57:18,396 --> 00:57:20,352
If we're gonna have a chance
of catching Dom..

732
00:57:22,057 --> 00:57:24,146
We're gonna have to
be damn fast.

733
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:26,773
Maybe this could help.

734
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:34,432
We got a tank.
750 horsepower.

735
00:57:34,511 --> 00:57:38,371
6.6 liter V8 Duramax engine.

736
00:57:38,473 --> 00:57:42,491
With the M153 probe remotely
operated weapon station on top.

737
00:57:42,535 --> 00:57:44,590
You didn't get this
from drug dealers.

738
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,001
No. No that...

739
00:57:47,491 --> 00:57:48,921
United State's army weaponry.

740
00:57:48,991 --> 00:57:50,439
See the army developing
machines like this

741
00:57:50,463 --> 00:57:53,368
the soldiers could drive from a
mile way so they can stay safe.

742
00:57:53,523 --> 00:57:56,350
And alive. But luckily..

743
00:57:56,453 --> 00:58:00,013
There is a back up driver seat for
those of us who like to get more..

744
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:01,510
Hands on.

745
00:58:01,601 --> 00:58:04,540
I'm sitting there wondering this whole time
when this thing feeling badly

746
00:58:04,768 --> 00:58:05,768
and she's getting fact.

747
00:58:06,476 --> 00:58:10,563
No one is getting hands on it.
She doesn't go on some streets.

748
00:58:15,566 --> 00:58:17,462
I'm in love.

749
00:58:19,828 --> 00:58:23,479
Again? No. No...
That's a million dollar show car.

750
00:58:23,524 --> 00:58:25,432
The point is to not draw attention.

751
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,410
It's reverse psychology.

752
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,347
Dom will never see it coming.

753
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:30,541
It's neon orange,

754
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:33,512
The international space station
would see it coming.

755
00:58:34,312 --> 00:58:36,994
Go choose anything less inspeculous.

756
00:58:37,064 --> 00:58:38,064
No no.

757
00:58:38,089 --> 00:58:41,360
This is ridiculous. Hey my man,
you can put that down right there.

758
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:43,459
This is a gift. A real gift.

759
00:58:43,901 --> 00:58:44,967
I know what you're doing.

760
00:58:45,999 --> 00:58:48,258
I like your beard.
You're blanta.

761
00:58:48,296 --> 00:58:50,260
Black santa?

762
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,315
No, I'm serious.
Put it down right here..

763
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:21,860
What are you doing?

764
00:59:22,265 --> 00:59:24,328
Engine's mis-firing,
I gotta check it out.

765
00:59:24,372 --> 00:59:26,401
No. That's not part
of the plan, Dom.

766
00:59:26,445 --> 00:59:27,345
Clearly..

767
00:59:27,348 --> 00:59:30,381
But unless you want the engine
to cease on the job,

768
00:59:31,394 --> 00:59:33,332
You have five minutes.

769
00:59:45,305 --> 00:59:46,818
I want another visual.

770
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:55,825
I got an ATM

771
01:00:08,109 --> 01:00:09,186
I don't like this.

772
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:24,207
I want to see Toretto.

773
01:00:24,277 --> 01:00:25,317
There are no more cameras.

774
01:00:25,331 --> 01:00:26,334
Then find something.

775
01:00:26,409 --> 01:00:29,431
Punch in on something reflective
A car mirror, anything..

776
01:00:40,144 --> 01:00:43,443
- You know who I am?
- That's why I'm here.

777
01:00:43,655 --> 01:00:46,425
You know what I'm capable of.

778
01:00:47,568 --> 01:00:49,597
It's why I'm here.

779
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,608
I'll give you until
I finish my cup up.

780
01:00:53,085 --> 01:00:54,345
And I'm fucking thirsty.

781
01:00:54,795 --> 01:00:58,592
I got limited time.
So won't take up too much of yours.

782
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:00,701
Oh no.

783
01:01:00,742 --> 01:01:04,381
No, you've already taken everything
I have of value, Mr. Toretto,

784
01:01:04,481 --> 01:01:06,251
What more could you possibly want?

785
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:09,327
To give you something back.

786
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:19,984
Talk to me.

787
01:01:23,248 --> 01:01:25,311
Something's not right here.

788
01:01:26,157 --> 01:01:28,289
First time I saw my son...

789
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:31,135
was behind a bulletproof glass.

790
01:01:31,673 --> 01:01:35,318
When he reached me,
I couldn't hold on.

791
01:01:36,423 --> 01:01:39,262
It's the worst pain
I ever felt..

792
01:01:40,201 --> 01:01:42,436
I know you know
exactly how that feels.

793
01:01:44,414 --> 01:01:47,184
Maybe we could change that..

794
01:01:48,607 --> 01:01:49,304
I think..

795
01:01:49,516 --> 01:01:53,361
You are about to suggest
something really dodgy Mr Toretto.

796
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:01,325
It's why I'm here.

797
01:02:02,739 --> 01:02:05,245
Just punch in on something,
I'm not liking this.

798
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,843
Something is not right.

799
01:02:07,116 --> 01:02:09,330
- Rhodes, you close?
- Yeah.

800
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,667
- Go.
- The delivery truck's moving.

801
01:02:44,792 --> 01:02:46,292
Captain Deckard Shaw,

802
01:02:47,562 --> 01:02:50,263
distinguished himself
by acts of gallantry

803
01:02:50,265 --> 01:02:53,200
of the risk of his life above
and beyond the call of duty.

804
01:02:53,834 --> 01:02:57,362
His bold actions saved the lives of
hostages and his team mates.

805
01:02:58,173 --> 01:03:01,204
Recommendation: Victoria Cross.

806
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:04,246
Highest honor the British Government
has ever given.

807
01:03:05,947 --> 01:03:06,947
To a traitor.

808
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:11,374
Some about this old thing just
doesn't add up to me.

809
01:03:11,474 --> 01:03:13,378
Well then don't do the same
kind of funny math,

810
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:18,258
It says a DSS agent who has a
soul to stop a valid stolen EMP.

811
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:20,252
Sound familiar huh?

812
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:28,655
Wanna give me a hand?

813
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:33,143
- On three?
- Yeah.

814
01:03:33,323 --> 01:03:34,323
One two..

815
01:03:38,316 --> 01:03:40,306
You know, you can tell this in
another letter..

816
01:03:40,495 --> 01:03:42,415
But maybe we could've caused
some serious damage.

817
01:03:43,221 --> 01:03:45,246
- Yes, we could have.
- Yeah.

818
01:03:46,257 --> 01:03:47,540
Shame I'll have to punch you,

819
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:49,351
head of defend,
when this is all over.

820
01:03:51,762 --> 01:03:54,164
Ah well.
With all due respect, Captain,

821
01:03:54,199 --> 01:03:56,244
When this whole thing is over
we're gonna find a location

822
01:03:56,268 --> 01:03:58,327
and I'm gonna knock your teeth
so far down your throat.

823
01:03:58,337 --> 01:04:01,204
You're gonna stick a toothbrush
right up in your ass to brush up.

824
01:04:08,247 --> 01:04:10,007
Give me God's eyes.

825
01:04:10,549 --> 01:04:12,943
- God's eye active.
- Thanks.

826
01:04:13,719 --> 01:04:15,687
Let's find us some Russian.

827
01:04:15,955 --> 01:04:18,622
That spy with my little lie...

828
01:04:18,858 --> 01:04:21,627
Minister of defense.

829
01:04:38,597 --> 01:04:40,721
<i>We land back in Moscow by nine.</i>

830
01:04:40,949 --> 01:04:45,687
<i>Here's the latest defense report,
All the items in yesterday's meet.</i>

831
01:04:47,588 --> 01:04:48,974
Upload this coordinates
to Dom's nav.

832
01:04:48,998 --> 01:04:49,998
Copy that.

833
01:05:13,716 --> 01:05:15,650
He's in the third car.

834
01:05:16,252 --> 01:05:18,713
It's a guard class limousine.

835
01:05:32,669 --> 01:05:33,727
Where's my team?

836
01:05:34,104 --> 01:05:36,024
- Where's his team?
- There's no sign of 'em yet.

837
01:05:36,106 --> 01:05:37,564
They are off the grid.

838
01:05:37,574 --> 01:05:39,565
Probably just bunker down somewhere.

839
01:05:39,609 --> 01:05:41,543
Closing in on him.

840
01:05:42,846 --> 01:05:43,713
You guys ready?

841
01:05:43,747 --> 01:05:45,738
One thing I can guarantee you Dom.

842
01:05:46,116 --> 01:05:48,108
No one's ready for this.

843
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:50,183
I want every with
chip with the GEODIE exploits

844
01:05:50,214 --> 01:05:52,785
in a two mile radius
around that motorcade now.

845
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:54,145
There's over a thousands of them.

846
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,890
Hack 'em all.

847
01:06:13,078 --> 01:06:14,243
It's zombie time.

848
01:06:22,588 --> 01:06:24,413
I'd buckle up if I were you.

849
01:06:25,019 --> 01:06:26,019
<i>AUTO-DRIVE ACTIVATED.</i>

850
01:07:26,889 --> 01:07:27,889
<i>Hey...!</i>

851
01:07:36,365 --> 01:07:38,133
Target the motorcade.

852
01:07:48,277 --> 01:07:50,141
And here they come.

853
01:07:55,018 --> 01:07:56,110
<i>What is going on?</i>

854
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:58,951
Ouch.

855
01:08:01,349 --> 01:08:02,352
<i>Drive fast!</i>

856
01:08:07,998 --> 01:08:09,017
Police escort down..

857
01:08:09,634 --> 01:08:12,061
Take out the lead and follow cars.

858
01:08:27,732 --> 01:08:29,008
<i>Drive! Drive!</i>

859
01:08:38,664 --> 01:08:40,856
- Two more down.
- Still a new warranty.

860
01:08:41,056 --> 01:08:44,004
<i>There's more cars ahead of us.
Shoot their engines.</i>

861
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:53,220
<i>Oh God!</i>

862
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,019
<i>We got an army of cars
driving themselves.</i>

863
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:10,379
<i>Send backup! Send S.W.A.T!</i>

864
01:09:10,449 --> 01:09:12,474
<i>I don't care if you send the
goddamn boy scout...</i>

865
01:09:12,664 --> 01:09:15,867
<i>- Just send up some help!</i>
- Now that's Dom.

866
01:09:21,037 --> 01:09:22,368
<i>Faster, faster!</i>

867
01:09:44,066 --> 01:09:45,966
The motorcade just turned on 7th.

868
01:09:46,001 --> 01:09:48,060
Perfect. Make it rain.

869
01:10:46,031 --> 01:10:47,896
Target immobilized.

870
01:10:48,401 --> 01:10:50,027
You are up Dom.

871
01:11:04,392 --> 01:11:07,182
<i>- Who the hell is that?
- What is he doing?</i>

872
01:11:10,494 --> 01:11:11,911
<i>What the hell
are you waiting for?</i>

873
01:11:12,061 --> 01:11:13,301
<i>Shoot him!</i>

874
01:11:13,746 --> 01:11:15,641
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

875
01:11:24,192 --> 01:11:25,373
<i>I'm out.</i>

876
01:11:27,879 --> 01:11:28,203
<i>Shit.</i>

877
01:11:28,273 --> 01:11:30,649
<i>Don't worry sir.
This car is bulletproof.</i>

878
01:11:30,928 --> 01:11:32,508
<i>You'll be safe in here.</i>

879
01:11:36,516 --> 01:11:38,418
<i>- Give me the case.
- Give him the case.</i>

880
01:11:38,537 --> 01:11:42,622
<i>These are nuclear launch codes.
We cannot give it to him.</i>

881
01:11:47,816 --> 01:11:49,253
<i>What is he doing now?</i>

882
01:12:06,122 --> 01:12:08,337
<i>He just cut a hole
in our gas tank.</i>

883
01:12:35,078 --> 01:12:37,279
Good work, Dom.

884
01:12:37,481 --> 01:12:38,724
Meet you at the pick-up.

885
01:12:49,256 --> 01:12:50,998
I think I know
where my team's at.

886
01:12:51,395 --> 01:12:54,330
- Where?
- Right in front of me.

887
01:13:05,977 --> 01:13:09,377
This is on you.
Get out of there, Dom.

888
01:13:09,414 --> 01:13:10,916
Guys, I know why Dom's here.

889
01:13:11,418 --> 01:13:14,104
Police scanners are saying
he's stolen Nuclear Football.

890
01:13:17,357 --> 01:13:20,684
It's over, Toretto.
Get your ass out of the car now.

891
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:28,940
That's how you wanna play this?

892
01:13:29,702 --> 01:13:30,770
Let's play.

893
01:13:37,111 --> 01:13:38,636
Don't do this, Dom.

894
01:13:44,218 --> 01:13:45,748
- What're you doing?
- It's a trap!

895
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:13,443
Now I know what it feels like
be every cop ever chasing us.

896
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:15,080
I'm gonna get a
little close and I ped him.

897
01:14:15,104 --> 01:14:16,651
Oh, so you just gonna take Dom?

898
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:20,521
Little Nobody has clearly
lost his little mind.

899
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:33,928
I'm on him.

900
01:14:33,971 --> 01:14:35,871
Easy, work together.

901
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:46,351
<i>- Look out!</i>
- Wait, wait, wait!

902
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:49,251
Oh shit.

903
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:57,248
I will take the short cut.

904
01:15:10,475 --> 01:15:11,985
Look out!
Watch these people.

905
01:15:13,243 --> 01:15:14,917
Big Sexy coming through!

906
01:15:44,444 --> 01:15:45,824
Not this time, Dom.

907
01:16:44,941 --> 01:16:46,840
Stretch him out.
Hold them.

908
01:17:14,972 --> 01:17:17,041
He gotta have about
2000 Horse Power in that thing.

909
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:18,940
Try 3000..

910
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:24,014
Try Five.

911
01:17:32,275 --> 01:17:33,437
Get out of there.

912
01:17:33,637 --> 01:17:34,637
I'm working on it.

913
01:17:34,694 --> 01:17:36,856
Stop working on it, and do it..

914
01:17:48,908 --> 01:17:51,077
No, no no...
It's my Bentley.

915
01:18:01,654 --> 01:18:02,654
No!

916
01:18:30,652 --> 01:18:33,644
Get that case and run!

917
01:18:45,234 --> 01:18:46,560
Move!

918
01:18:52,075 --> 01:18:54,134
They thought...
this was gonna be a streetfight.

919
01:18:54,234 --> 01:18:55,333
You wait for it..

920
01:18:59,081 --> 01:19:00,081
No!

921
01:19:12,696 --> 01:19:14,596
Letty, stop!

922
01:19:18,736 --> 01:19:20,664
What are you gonna do?

923
01:19:33,218 --> 01:19:37,682
I don't know why you're doing this,
but I know one thing.

924
01:19:38,556 --> 01:19:40,524
You love me.

925
01:19:44,296 --> 01:19:46,691
And you're not gonna to shoot me.

926
01:19:57,644 --> 01:20:01,306
You should've given him the case,
cause I won't chase you.

927
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,676
Okay.

928
01:20:05,025 --> 01:20:07,250
I will just take it
from a dead girl.

929
01:20:09,622 --> 01:20:11,123
You willing to die for it?

930
01:20:29,676 --> 01:20:31,241
Let's go then.

931
01:20:52,417 --> 01:20:53,880
Anything?

932
01:20:54,119 --> 01:20:55,950
They're gone.

933
01:20:56,821 --> 01:20:59,280
And D.O.D confirmed
it was a nuclear football.

934
01:20:59,524 --> 01:21:02,984
He's got an EMP and
nuclear launch codes.

935
01:21:03,027 --> 01:21:04,509
I don't know what it is,

936
01:21:04,579 --> 01:21:06,985
but they're building
towards something.

937
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:08,895
Deckard?

938
01:21:09,967 --> 01:21:10,967
He didn't make it.

939
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,128
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.

940
01:21:36,052 --> 01:21:38,913
You're gonna Letty just walk
away with the codes.

941
01:21:38,925 --> 01:21:41,894
- You've got the codes!
- Rhodes got the codes.

942
01:21:41,928 --> 01:21:44,954
You made the choice
to let her go.

943
01:21:46,031 --> 01:21:48,090
And now I have to make
one on my own.

944
01:22:00,044 --> 01:22:04,312
They are adorable little things,
aren't they?

945
01:22:04,748 --> 01:22:06,407
I hope I don't hurt him.

946
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:14,320
Look, Cipher, I did exactly
what you asked me to do.

947
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:16,003
Don't do this.

948
01:22:16,203 --> 01:22:19,425
- This is your doing.
- My doing?

949
01:22:28,702 --> 01:22:30,427
Please don't hurt him.
I'm begging you.

950
01:22:30,738 --> 01:22:33,236
I don't want you to beg.

951
01:22:35,642 --> 01:22:38,839
- I want you to learn.
- Learn what?

952
01:22:39,779 --> 01:22:44,738
I understand why you did
what you did. I really do.

953
01:22:50,255 --> 01:22:51,822
But it was the wrong choice.

954
01:22:53,123 --> 01:22:55,792
This is a consequence, Dom.

955
01:22:57,194 --> 01:22:59,728
No! No! No...

956
01:23:00,763 --> 01:23:02,690
Wait. Wait.

957
01:23:04,701 --> 01:23:06,692
No!

958
01:23:33,225 --> 01:23:36,591
Can you pull up the footage
from the guy in the ally.

959
01:23:36,629 --> 01:23:38,824
- Traffic cams.
- I got you.

960
01:23:43,201 --> 01:23:46,703
I knew it.
I recognize that guy.

961
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:48,235
That's Connor Rhodes.

962
01:23:48,305 --> 01:23:50,500
I met him when I was working
with Shaw's brother.

963
01:23:51,441 --> 01:23:53,442
He wanted us to get the
Nightshade device him.

964
01:23:54,177 --> 01:23:55,308
Connor Rhodes.

965
01:23:56,078 --> 01:23:58,945
He's also linked to somebody
who I like to forget.

966
01:23:58,981 --> 01:24:00,141
Mose Jakande.

967
01:24:00,983 --> 01:24:03,008
Warlord who tried to get God's eye.

968
01:24:03,019 --> 01:24:06,352
Which means that's twice that
Dom has messed up Cipher's business.

969
01:24:19,133 --> 01:24:20,987
Everything you're feeling right now,

970
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,002
that's rage, sense of loss.
It's not real.

971
01:24:25,272 --> 01:24:29,163
It's a survival instinct wired
deep into our brains.

972
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:32,968
To ensure continuation of species.

973
01:24:33,078 --> 01:24:35,905
When early men went visit
a watering hole...

974
01:24:36,914 --> 01:24:42,045
If they didn't watch their child,
they got snatched by a crocodile.

975
01:24:42,186 --> 01:24:48,991
Their brains would create a painful
but a structural memory.

976
01:24:49,726 --> 01:24:52,053
So it will never happen again.

977
01:24:53,896 --> 01:24:57,024
This idea of family
that is so core with you,

978
01:24:57,032 --> 01:24:59,057
that rules your world...

979
01:25:00,069 --> 01:25:02,969
It's a biological lie.

980
01:25:04,005 --> 01:25:06,064
You don't have to accept it.

981
01:25:08,009 --> 01:25:09,267
I don't!

982
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:15,167
Did you really could think
you could destroy two of my teams.

983
01:25:15,382 --> 01:25:17,110
Without any repercussions?

984
01:25:18,017 --> 01:25:20,263
I wouldn't have even
looked your way..

985
01:25:20,333 --> 01:25:21,851
If you hadn't done that.

986
01:25:21,887 --> 01:25:24,048
You didn't even know you had a kid.

987
01:25:25,024 --> 01:25:26,414
You can thank me for that.

988
01:25:26,484 --> 01:25:28,891
And start doing the job
I'm asking you to do.

989
01:25:28,893 --> 01:25:30,087
Help you start a war.

990
01:25:30,128 --> 01:25:32,096
Is that what you think I want.

991
01:25:34,932 --> 01:25:36,991
That's so limited.

992
01:25:37,968 --> 01:25:40,061
I didn't take that
football to start a war..

993
01:25:40,104 --> 01:25:43,038
Anymore than I took your son
to start a family.

994
01:25:43,873 --> 01:25:45,932
Taking your son got me the codes..

995
01:25:45,975 --> 01:25:47,886
The codes will get me the nukes,

996
01:25:47,956 --> 01:25:50,343
and the nukes will
get me what I want...

997
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:55,111
Today, tomorrow...
and every day after that.

998
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,015
What's that?

999
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:00,853
Accountability.

1000
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:05,018
The second I fire off
one of those nukes..

1001
01:26:05,025 --> 01:26:07,993
I put the superpowers of this world
on notice that...

1002
01:26:08,027 --> 01:26:10,052
when they cross the line,

1003
01:26:12,432 --> 01:26:15,931
I'm gonna be there
to hold the responsible..

1004
01:26:16,869 --> 01:26:18,996
Because the truth is, Dom...

1005
01:26:19,037 --> 01:26:21,096
To the world out there...

1006
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:26,935
I'm the crocodile
at the watering hole.

1007
01:26:32,583 --> 01:26:34,366
You've got one last job to do.

1008
01:26:36,052 --> 01:26:37,952
Cipher..

1009
01:26:47,029 --> 01:26:49,997
If I were you,
I would kiss my son.

1010
01:26:52,066 --> 01:26:55,685
Because whether you value it or not,
all of this...

1011
01:26:56,937 --> 01:26:59,797
Your plane, your security and you...

1012
01:27:01,141 --> 01:27:03,574
are still on this
earth because of him.

1013
01:27:09,115 --> 01:27:10,676
The problem we have
with tracking Cipher

1014
01:27:10,716 --> 01:27:12,049
is there's nothing to trace then.

1015
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:13,487
Now we have Rhodes' information.

1016
01:27:13,799 --> 01:27:15,514
And we're getting
snapshots of this data

1017
01:27:15,584 --> 01:27:17,080
before it's scrubbed off the net.

1018
01:27:17,322 --> 01:27:19,693
That looks like somebody's
bank accounts? Always just...

1019
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:21,819
The Longitude.

1020
01:27:21,926 --> 01:27:24,087
Given the fact that Dom
hit the Russian Motorcade

1021
01:27:24,128 --> 01:27:27,063
safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead, bring up the map.

1022
01:27:27,732 --> 01:27:29,749
Great, let's start here
run the possibilities.

1023
01:27:30,567 --> 01:27:32,974
Yalta, Poltava.

1024
01:27:33,174 --> 01:27:34,894
Looks like they just threw
letters together.

1025
01:27:35,071 --> 01:27:37,181
- Konyert.
- It's Vladupi.

1026
01:27:37,381 --> 01:27:38,381
What are you doing here?

1027
01:27:39,207 --> 01:27:41,294
Thought I was gonna check in on you
from time to time,

1028
01:27:41,318 --> 01:27:42,379
To see you how you're doing.

1029
01:27:42,403 --> 01:27:44,076
By the way, not so hot.

1030
01:27:44,275 --> 01:27:46,841
But there's nothing in Vladiven.
It's just ice..

1031
01:27:46,941 --> 01:27:47,962
That funny...

1032
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:50,447
Could've sworn there was a
secret Russian naval base

1033
01:27:50,461 --> 01:27:52,280
with the retrophilic
cold war Submarines.

1034
01:27:52,853 --> 01:27:55,014
Well, technically,
it's not Russian anymore.

1035
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:58,000
Base was take by a terror grope
of military separatists

1036
01:27:58,049 --> 01:28:00,489
about a month ago. And the
Russians haven't taken it back yet.

1037
01:28:00,494 --> 01:28:03,020
So there is a little
window of opportunity here.

1038
01:28:03,062 --> 01:28:05,224
Russian submarines,
nuclear football,

1039
01:28:05,498 --> 01:28:09,023
it sounds like everything we do
our legs gonna be bombed off.

1040
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:12,093
Sounds like you're still
a No. 11 on the list.

1041
01:28:12,904 --> 01:28:15,119
It sounds like you've changed
since you look punk ass.

1042
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:16,661
Facial hairs and camen.

1043
01:28:16,829 --> 01:28:18,612
Guys... guys. Hey.

1044
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:20,288
We gotta call this in
all the way up the chain.

1045
01:28:20,312 --> 01:28:21,412
That's good thinking champ.

1046
01:28:21,612 --> 01:28:25,274
Except... unfortunately the
Russian Minister of Defense.

1047
01:28:25,482 --> 01:28:28,170
Got himself involved in little
incident on US territory

1048
01:28:28,518 --> 01:28:30,438
and two governments
aren't talking to each other for a while.

1049
01:28:30,453 --> 01:28:32,133
By the time they do...
It will be too late.

1050
01:28:32,292 --> 01:28:33,655
So, any other suggestions?

1051
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:36,651
Yeah, I got one.

1052
01:28:37,493 --> 01:28:39,461
How about we just
stop them ourselves?

1053
01:28:39,528 --> 01:28:41,586
You're talking about a
Russian Military Base.

1054
01:28:41,629 --> 01:28:42,561
Separatists.

1055
01:28:42,563 --> 01:28:43,935
Whatever. It's suicide.

1056
01:28:44,035 --> 01:28:45,665
It's stopping world war 3.

1057
01:28:47,634 --> 01:28:48,899
What's it gonna be rook?

1058
01:28:48,936 --> 01:28:50,994
You're gonna close your eyes
on this one too?

1059
01:28:51,537 --> 01:28:52,821
Pray that the apocalypse

1060
01:28:52,891 --> 01:28:55,405
doesn't come knocking on
your mama's front door?

1061
01:28:55,408 --> 01:28:57,216
Or are you're gonna saddle up,

1062
01:28:57,285 --> 01:29:00,228
be a man and save the
entire goddamn world.

1063
01:29:06,417 --> 01:29:09,352
You know, thank god
they read it out.

1064
01:29:09,453 --> 01:29:10,420
What's that?

1065
01:29:10,454 --> 01:29:12,414
- Rule number three.
- Which is?

1066
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:14,815
There are no rules.

1067
01:29:17,327 --> 01:29:18,727
What did I told you, Luke?

1068
01:29:19,195 --> 01:29:20,329
I knew he'd get in three.

1069
01:29:20,829 --> 01:29:22,141
Areal transport leaves in an hour.

1070
01:29:22,165 --> 01:29:23,764
Take whatever vehicle you want.

1071
01:29:23,766 --> 01:29:26,445
- All bets are off.
- All bets are off. Bets are off?

1072
01:29:26,645 --> 01:29:27,833
<i>See you later...</i>

1073
01:29:54,039 --> 01:29:55,961
Letty I don't like telling
you this one thing,

1074
01:29:56,147 --> 01:29:57,713
The game's changed.

1075
01:29:58,074 --> 01:29:59,749
Before we were trying
just to catch Dom,

1076
01:29:59,982 --> 01:30:01,226
but now after all of this...

1077
01:30:01,377 --> 01:30:03,901
I want you to know,
if I have to...

1078
01:30:04,545 --> 01:30:06,878
I'm gonna put him down..

1079
01:30:08,647 --> 01:30:11,847
Then you might have to
take us both down.

1080
01:30:11,916 --> 01:30:14,753
I'm freezing man.
This ain't for me.

1081
01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:17,681
I come from a different
kind of lifestyle brah.

1082
01:30:20,021 --> 01:30:24,012
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with.

1083
01:30:24,756 --> 01:30:28,957
I try to take a piss,
I ain't even recognize myself.

1084
01:30:29,192 --> 01:30:31,490
Now that's entirely too
much information.

1085
01:30:31,559 --> 01:30:33,017
I'm just saying.

1086
01:30:33,028 --> 01:30:34,643
Well, one thing is for sure.

1087
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,785
Dom's gotta be either working
with them or making a train

1088
01:30:37,884 --> 01:30:41,389
cause no one will be this insane
to hit this place without a damn army.

1089
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:43,654
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

1090
01:30:45,935 --> 01:30:46,935
Speak of the Devil.

1091
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:58,336
Alright, Dom, you're one step
closer to that family reunion.

1092
01:30:58,536 --> 01:30:59,536
400 meters to base.

1093
01:30:59,876 --> 01:31:02,568
Prep the EMP.
Let's take these defenses down.

1094
01:31:14,063 --> 01:31:15,914
<i>We have a possible
threat incoming.</i>

1095
01:31:15,952 --> 01:31:18,697
<i>Raise the barricade,
As soon as possible.</i>

1096
01:31:36,053 --> 01:31:38,465
<i>We've lost power,
get to your positions now.</i>

1097
01:31:40,065 --> 01:31:42,658
Gates are open.
Let's get this party started.

1098
01:31:58,475 --> 01:32:00,075
- EMP's are charging.
- How long?

1099
01:32:00,378 --> 01:32:01,378
60 seconds.

1100
01:32:02,577 --> 01:32:04,770
Alright, Dom,
You've one pulse left in that EMP.

1101
01:32:05,514 --> 01:32:07,540
That sub is heavily insulated.

1102
01:32:07,740 --> 01:32:10,421
You're gonna need to be right
underneath it, for this thing to work.

1103
01:32:34,457 --> 01:32:35,457
Come on.

1104
01:32:35,489 --> 01:32:37,821
<i>Engaging target.
He's beneath the Sub.</i>

1105
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:46,775
<i>I'm loosing control, mayday, mayday.
I'm going down.</i>

1106
01:32:53,306 --> 01:32:55,379
Yes, two birds with one stone.

1107
01:32:55,579 --> 01:32:56,739
We've got control of the sub.

1108
01:32:56,908 --> 01:32:58,038
Dom, we are good.

1109
01:32:58,776 --> 01:33:00,573
Head over to the Rendezvous.
Ok Matty...

1110
01:33:00,911 --> 01:33:02,635
Let's take this baby for a spin.

1111
01:33:08,663 --> 01:33:09,663
Damn!

1112
01:33:09,712 --> 01:33:12,980
I think Cipher just rebooted
that Sub's command system.

1113
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:14,555
What the hell is he talking about?

1114
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:15,982
In Leyman's terms...

1115
01:33:16,119 --> 01:33:18,211
She just carjacked a submarine.

1116
01:33:19,588 --> 01:33:23,181
We can't let it get away.
There's the control room.

1117
01:33:23,823 --> 01:33:25,263
If you can get me
into that warehouse

1118
01:33:25,592 --> 01:33:27,767
I can tap with network
and counter hack Cipher.

1119
01:33:27,826 --> 01:33:29,185
Keep it from flowing into water.

1120
01:33:29,226 --> 01:33:31,553
No, what we need to do is
get me on that sub.

1121
01:33:31,728 --> 01:33:33,633
I find the weapon's room
and I can pull the lunch chip

1122
01:33:33,657 --> 01:33:35,177
before she can fire
any of those nukes.

1123
01:33:35,196 --> 01:33:36,196
That is too crazy.

1124
01:33:36,731 --> 01:33:38,760
- Just saying it's too dangerous.
- We'll do both.

1125
01:34:03,612 --> 01:34:04,612
Knock, knock!

1126
01:34:09,515 --> 01:34:11,228
Five vehicles just reached the base.

1127
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:13,528
They just don't give up, do they..

1128
01:34:22,656 --> 01:34:25,146
A'right. Let's haul ass team.
Double time, double time.

1129
01:34:32,996 --> 01:34:34,227
Letty, let's roll.

1130
01:34:36,758 --> 01:34:37,990
Go, go, go, go.

1131
01:35:14,485 --> 01:35:15,485
Change of plans, Dom.

1132
01:35:15,549 --> 01:35:17,882
I'm sending you the co-ordinates,
head there immediately.

1133
01:35:18,082 --> 01:35:21,113
- I'm done. I want my son.
- I'll tell you when you're done.

1134
01:35:21,123 --> 01:35:25,023
Your team is in play, now meet Rhodes
and follow my instruction.

1135
01:35:31,395 --> 01:35:32,754
I got you covered, go.

1136
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:39,054
Move, move!
Get out of here, go go!

1137
01:35:46,402 --> 01:35:49,184
Ok, how do you like this?

1138
01:35:51,272 --> 01:35:54,052
- Remote link has been separated.
- I'll take care of this.

1139
01:35:58,109 --> 01:35:59,602
Hi Ramsey.

1140
01:36:03,246 --> 01:36:04,547
She's regaining control.

1141
01:36:04,801 --> 01:36:06,034
Damn it, she's good.

1142
01:36:47,338 --> 01:36:49,192
They are entering
the Weapon's room.

1143
01:36:49,262 --> 01:36:50,263
Oh that's cute.

1144
01:36:56,175 --> 01:36:59,950
Go, pull pull!
Roman, guard up by the chip, go.

1145
01:37:03,746 --> 01:37:06,789
Oh she's slick.
Gonna have to do better in that way.

1146
01:37:08,869 --> 01:37:10,790
Ok,
now you're starting to piss me off.

1147
01:37:26,109 --> 01:37:28,226
Ramsey,
how much time we talking to you?

1148
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:32,190
You're smart,
but no smart enough.

1149
01:37:35,196 --> 01:37:36,272
She's locked me out.

1150
01:37:39,966 --> 01:37:42,678
Tez, I can't stop. Now
you're gonna have to pull that chip.

1151
01:37:42,735 --> 01:37:44,496
I can't.
This thing's going into attack mode.

1152
01:37:44,707 --> 01:37:46,815
The door's not gonna open
until you pull the chip.

1153
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:51,163
Tez we got no idea what the hell
we are looking for.

1154
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:53,240
I got it.

1155
01:37:56,375 --> 01:37:59,043
What in the hell are you guys doing?

1156
01:37:59,177 --> 01:38:01,414
It wasn't me, okay?

1157
01:38:01,512 --> 01:38:03,291
It will be labeled
"Guidance Go".

1158
01:38:04,213 --> 01:38:06,146
- Ok. I got something.
- What?

1159
01:38:06,148 --> 01:38:09,538
It says haha.. slack
slack back

1160
01:38:09,737 --> 01:38:12,609
smoke, dear jack n jack.

1161
01:38:12,785 --> 01:38:14,082
Do you understand that?

1162
01:38:38,833 --> 01:38:40,445
Well, nasty.

1163
01:38:54,108 --> 01:38:55,972
Quite a show.

1164
01:38:58,743 --> 01:39:00,076
Arming the nuke..

1165
01:39:05,082 --> 01:39:07,263
Nuke's going hot,
she's trying to fire this thing.

1166
01:39:07,463 --> 01:39:09,703
- Roger that, we're moving out.
- Disable the nukes.

1167
01:39:09,779 --> 01:39:10,481
Roman, what are you seeing?

1168
01:39:10,517 --> 01:39:12,798
- Come on, Talk to me.
- I don't see shit. I'm holding on.

1169
01:39:14,487 --> 01:39:15,646
Now we have a countdown.

1170
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:21,292
What the hell is going on man?

1171
01:39:21,524 --> 01:39:24,457
We are about to launch a nuclear
missile, what the hell is going on.

1172
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:25,584
Pull the damn chip.

1173
01:39:28,894 --> 01:39:31,394
Countdown. Countdown.
Look for a countdown.

1174
01:39:31,429 --> 01:39:32,418
What countdown?

1175
01:39:32,430 --> 01:39:34,397
The missile needs to
activate for launch.

1176
01:39:34,464 --> 01:39:36,647
The countdown timer
won't be in Russian.

1177
01:39:36,717 --> 01:39:37,557
The countdown.

1178
01:39:37,604 --> 01:39:40,107
Let's show the world
what we've got.

1179
01:39:41,401 --> 01:39:42,594
No. No. No.
Don't press that.

1180
01:39:45,704 --> 01:39:46,704
I got it.

1181
01:39:48,472 --> 01:39:50,530
Something is wrong.
It won't launch.

1182
01:39:51,807 --> 01:39:53,531
Get that sub out of there.

1183
01:39:54,074 --> 01:39:55,405
Now!

1184
01:39:56,810 --> 01:39:58,543
Move your ass Roman.

1185
01:40:06,649 --> 01:40:07,472
You alright?

1186
01:40:07,516 --> 01:40:10,409
There's nothing alright
about any of this. Let's go.

1187
01:40:10,609 --> 01:40:11,609
What about the missiles?

1188
01:40:12,785 --> 01:40:14,611
We got the chip,
no nukes for her.

1189
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,417
Hell yeah. Let's roll.

1190
01:40:21,150 --> 01:40:24,143
Guys we got company.
A lot of company.

1191
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:30,067
Alright team, here is the plan.

1192
01:40:30,091 --> 01:40:32,173
There is a Sea lock
at the opening of the bay,

1193
01:40:32,373 --> 01:40:33,554
We get there first, and close it,

1194
01:40:33,578 --> 01:40:36,133
we can stop the submarine
from escaping into open water.

1195
01:40:36,348 --> 01:40:37,671
And disappearing forever.

1196
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:42,204
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles south west.

1197
01:40:42,704 --> 01:40:45,043
10 miles?
Like I make it in 10 seconds.

1198
01:40:55,949 --> 01:40:58,382
What's the matter Roman,
you forgot the snow tyre?

1199
01:41:00,419 --> 01:41:01,887
Loving that Lambo now?

1200
01:41:12,287 --> 01:41:14,571
Alright everyone, hold you
with that launch trip later.

1201
01:41:14,798 --> 01:41:15,699
Right now I want that sub,

1202
01:41:15,769 --> 01:41:17,330
in deep water,
where no one can find it.

1203
01:41:17,354 --> 01:41:19,208
Find me the fastest
route out of that bay.

1204
01:41:19,278 --> 01:41:20,278
Copy that.

1205
01:41:29,865 --> 01:41:31,357
Why are they shooting at me?

1206
01:41:31,557 --> 01:41:33,549
I think off you're in that
orange Lamborghini I don't know.

1207
01:41:33,552 --> 01:41:35,338
Shut up Tez.

1208
01:41:40,691 --> 01:41:41,409
Dom.

1209
01:41:41,609 --> 01:41:43,427
Do you really wanna
put that car in gear?

1210
01:41:45,696 --> 01:41:46,696
Do you?

1211
01:41:50,552 --> 01:41:51,840
I don't think so.

1212
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:53,124
They're heading for the sea lock.

1213
01:41:53,148 --> 01:41:54,582
They're trying to trap
the sub in the bay.

1214
01:41:54,606 --> 01:41:56,951
I should have taken care of this
a long time ago.

1215
01:41:57,651 --> 01:42:00,430
Rhodes, check his team out.

1216
01:42:00,929 --> 01:42:01,934
I'm on it.

1217
01:42:07,783 --> 01:42:09,243
Roman, get in front of me.

1218
01:42:16,057 --> 01:42:17,393
Ok, y'all wanna play it rough?

1219
01:42:18,926 --> 01:42:19,926
Now it's my turn.

1220
01:42:34,141 --> 01:42:35,556
Yeah, baby!

1221
01:42:45,051 --> 01:42:47,318
Guys,
we got snow mobile on the right.

1222
01:42:49,122 --> 01:42:50,915
They're going to flank us.

1223
01:42:55,093 --> 01:42:56,958
No they ain't!

1224
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,900
Oh shit!

1225
01:43:17,481 --> 01:43:18,481
Tez!

1226
01:43:18,749 --> 01:43:20,115
Roman hold tight.
I'm on the way.

1227
01:43:24,755 --> 01:43:28,185
I don't wanna go swimming. No!

1228
01:43:32,996 --> 01:43:34,930
Really Tez?

1229
01:43:36,967 --> 01:43:39,833
Oh, No. No. No.

1230
01:43:43,538 --> 01:43:44,538
Oh shit.

1231
01:43:47,126 --> 01:43:48,251
Roman, grab your door.

1232
01:43:48,469 --> 01:43:49,469
Tez!

1233
01:43:49,563 --> 01:43:50,811
Grab the door Roman.

1234
01:43:51,093 --> 01:43:53,715
It's all gone.
Oh Shit.

1235
01:44:05,769 --> 01:44:06,769
Roman, hang on.

1236
01:44:08,234 --> 01:44:09,234
Tej!

1237
01:44:13,069 --> 01:44:14,333
Get me off this thing.

1238
01:44:14,806 --> 01:44:15,860
Tez.

1239
01:44:20,306 --> 01:44:21,306
Come on!

1240
01:44:35,854 --> 01:44:38,258
Alright,
I've had enough of this shit!

1241
01:44:52,389 --> 01:44:54,174
Number 11 my Ass.

1242
01:44:56,606 --> 01:44:59,100
Don't shrink it.
We got a sub to catch, get in.

1243
01:45:13,161 --> 01:45:13,407
What?

1244
01:45:13,477 --> 01:45:15,593
The pressure is on alert
in the cargo hold.

1245
01:45:15,682 --> 01:45:16,863
Drop it to 10 thousand feet.

1246
01:45:18,029 --> 01:45:20,057
I know how much these people
mean to you.

1247
01:45:20,464 --> 01:45:22,476
So I'll let you pick
the first target.

1248
01:45:22,776 --> 01:45:24,576
I'm not picking target
from a mile away.

1249
01:45:26,293 --> 01:45:29,158
I'd stand face to face,
and look 'em dead in the eye.

1250
01:45:30,772 --> 01:45:31,853
Ok.

1251
01:45:32,374 --> 01:45:34,141
The wife it is.

1252
01:45:52,327 --> 01:45:55,579
Nice plane.
I'm gonna enjoy her remains.

1253
01:45:55,996 --> 01:45:57,151
You don't go get any ideas.

1254
01:45:57,221 --> 01:45:58,889
You and planes don't have a good history.

1255
01:46:01,703 --> 01:46:02,703
No shit.

1256
01:46:04,537 --> 01:46:07,981
Let's go scarface.
The arseholes ain't gonna kill themselves.

1257
01:46:11,544 --> 01:46:13,535
Pull up surveillance, right now.

1258
01:46:18,517 --> 01:46:19,643
Surprise.

1259
01:46:21,553 --> 01:46:23,521
Pierce must be dead.

1260
01:46:34,072 --> 01:46:36,619
<i>You're driving.
I said it from the beginning.</i>

1261
01:46:36,689 --> 01:46:38,406
<i>No way, I'm not driving.</i>

1262
01:46:39,670 --> 01:46:43,572
We have a security breach in the
cargo hold. Take care of it now.

1263
01:46:48,645 --> 01:46:51,794
Jesus Mum, you should
pose to avoid the nerves.

1264
01:46:51,864 --> 01:46:53,272
Oh, shut up, don't be such a baby.

1265
01:46:59,857 --> 01:47:01,592
Get to the pilot,
he's got the second key.

1266
01:47:01,662 --> 01:47:02,662
Wait for my signal.

1267
01:47:02,839 --> 01:47:04,216
Give Cipher my regards.

1268
01:47:05,584 --> 01:47:07,363
Did Torretto hold up his end of the deal?

1269
01:47:18,573 --> 01:47:21,542
He gave us this little thing here.

1270
01:47:21,742 --> 01:47:23,476
No, don't touch.

1271
01:47:23,611 --> 01:47:25,000
You can track Cipher with this,

1272
01:47:25,099 --> 01:47:28,324
but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of you.

1273
01:47:28,426 --> 01:47:30,432
Fine, I got contacts.

1274
01:47:31,586 --> 01:47:32,986
Now you're gonna take your brother.

1275
01:47:33,186 --> 01:47:34,321
- No.
- Yes.

1276
01:47:38,425 --> 01:47:39,585
Torretto knows where he is...

1277
01:47:40,393 --> 01:47:41,249
He's got this thing.

1278
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:44,530
He can see everything it's like it's
called the devil's bumhole or something?

1279
01:47:44,531 --> 01:47:47,625
- It's called the God's eyes.
- Yeah, well. Whatever.

1280
01:47:49,068 --> 01:47:51,595
There's no way
I'm using Owen, alright?

1281
01:47:51,704 --> 01:47:53,462
He's a lost cause.

1282
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,566
He's your brother, Deck.

1283
01:47:55,608 --> 01:47:59,476
He's my son.
He's our family.

1284
01:47:59,612 --> 01:48:01,480
And our family that died...

1285
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:04,241
Bloody shit happening.

1286
01:48:04,311 --> 01:48:06,492
You lied about, I mean,
I can't believe you.

1287
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:09,392
You've gotten upset,
you really upset your mother.

1288
01:48:09,654 --> 01:48:11,045
Call yourself a brother?

1289
01:48:11,122 --> 01:48:13,490
Look, I'm in, mum. Ok.

1290
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:16,660
Every time!

1291
01:48:21,665 --> 01:48:23,190
- Owen.
- In position.

1292
01:48:25,850 --> 01:48:26,850
Go.

1293
01:48:28,038 --> 01:48:29,130
I'm in.

1294
01:48:47,690 --> 01:48:49,590
I've got the package to lay on.

1295
01:48:49,859 --> 01:48:51,758
Whole pounds of him..

1296
01:49:12,479 --> 01:49:13,588
You made me miss my son?

1297
01:49:14,515 --> 01:49:15,841
What do you think you're doing?

1298
01:49:18,785 --> 01:49:20,776
Looking at you dead in the eye.

1299
01:49:43,308 --> 01:49:44,358
That was for Letty.

1300
01:49:49,114 --> 01:49:51,726
- Rhodes.
- He is no longer with us.

1301
01:49:52,551 --> 01:49:54,741
Rhodes picked the wrong target.

1302
01:49:55,853 --> 01:49:56,856
Congratulations Dom.

1303
01:49:58,332 --> 01:49:59,332
You just killed your son.

1304
01:49:59,823 --> 01:50:00,823
You are wrong.

1305
01:50:00,858 --> 01:50:02,108
I just saved him.

1306
01:50:03,361 --> 01:50:05,820
And you just took your foot
off the tiger's neck.

1307
01:50:13,803 --> 01:50:16,795
You're welcome.
It's gonna get noisy.

1308
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,705
This is for your relief.

1309
01:50:24,814 --> 01:50:25,814
Good?

1310
01:50:28,583 --> 01:50:29,743
Let's go.

1311
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:35,722
Go stop him, do not let him
get off this plane.

1312
01:50:39,323 --> 01:50:41,363
That truck's got enough munition
to take us all out.

1313
01:50:41,829 --> 01:50:42,849
We don't give 'em a target.

1314
01:50:42,873 --> 01:50:44,313
Everybody get in
front of us, line up

1315
01:50:44,430 --> 01:50:45,799
- we will take the hit.
- What?

1316
01:50:46,233 --> 01:50:47,861
I need to switch cars, right now.

1317
01:51:04,383 --> 01:51:06,437
- Roman, here comes the bad part.
- What?

1318
01:51:13,125 --> 01:51:15,153
Hang in there guys!
We're almost through the lock.

1319
01:51:15,661 --> 01:51:18,218
It's easy for you to say,
when your ass ain't on fire.

1320
01:51:23,911 --> 01:51:25,208
Alright little mate.

1321
01:51:25,637 --> 01:51:26,797
It's might be a little scary,

1322
01:51:27,799 --> 01:51:29,265
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

1323
01:51:40,685 --> 01:51:42,550
The music good?

1324
01:51:55,699 --> 01:51:56,723
They're locking on.

1325
01:51:56,767 --> 01:51:58,128
Sorry guys,
I got no trick for us..

1326
01:51:58,368 --> 01:52:00,364
- What do we do now?
- We start praying.

1327
01:52:23,692 --> 01:52:24,692
Hell yeah!

1328
01:52:37,138 --> 01:52:38,138
That's Dom!

1329
01:52:42,243 --> 01:52:44,627
- This guy in our side now?
- Who the hell cares?

1330
01:52:44,697 --> 01:52:45,996
He just saved our asses.

1331
01:52:49,449 --> 01:52:51,710
Good to be riding
with you again man.

1332
01:53:04,663 --> 01:53:06,183
Torretto just cleared the way
for them.

1333
01:53:06,323 --> 01:53:07,672
Someone give me something.

1334
01:53:07,872 --> 01:53:09,758
- Torpedoes are ready.
- Then launch them.

1335
01:53:28,319 --> 01:53:29,880
- Take the wheel.
- I ain't taking shit.

1336
01:53:29,902 --> 01:53:33,110
- Take the wheel!
- Where are you doing?

1337
01:53:34,558 --> 01:53:36,716
- This is crazy!
- Speed up,

1338
01:53:39,997 --> 01:53:42,022
- Left and back!
- What?

1339
01:53:42,032 --> 01:53:45,001
Turn the goddamn wheel to the left,
really quickly.

1340
01:53:51,007 --> 01:53:52,133
Boom, baby!

1341
01:53:59,248 --> 01:54:00,248
That's alright!

1342
01:54:06,153 --> 01:54:07,153
Back in the sink.

1343
01:54:22,036 --> 01:54:23,099
Where is that smile?

1344
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:25,096
There it is!

1345
01:54:30,678 --> 01:54:34,600
You're gonna shoot a baby
You shoud bust it...

1346
01:54:36,015 --> 01:54:37,336
You aren't gonna wanna see this?

1347
01:54:50,629 --> 01:54:51,629
Is that you or him?

1348
01:54:54,866 --> 01:54:55,963
Him.
Good.

1349
01:54:56,701 --> 01:54:57,701
The torpedo's missed,

1350
01:54:57,767 --> 01:54:59,853
they are gonna reach lock
before the sub does.

1351
01:54:59,953 --> 01:55:01,698
The hell they are.

1352
01:55:04,042 --> 01:55:05,736
Get ready for this.

1353
01:55:25,695 --> 01:55:26,593
Oh shit!

1354
01:55:26,596 --> 01:55:28,587
We're going to
need a bigger truck.

1355
01:55:53,456 --> 01:55:56,349
- Get us out of here.
- Why are you always yelling?

1356
01:56:00,127 --> 01:56:02,662
- This bitch is crazy!
- Look out!

1357
01:56:08,736 --> 01:56:10,600
That's not good.

1358
01:56:11,571 --> 01:56:13,539
That's not good.

1359
01:56:19,145 --> 01:56:20,508
We got this.

1360
01:56:33,091 --> 01:56:34,625
That's my girl.

1361
01:56:40,632 --> 01:56:41,474
The sub's too close.

1362
01:56:41,544 --> 01:56:43,600
We ain't making it
to the gate in time.

1363
01:56:43,601 --> 01:56:44,801
We just gonna let it get away?

1364
01:56:45,036 --> 01:56:46,331
Not if I know Dom.

1365
01:56:51,542 --> 01:56:52,702
You loose. Dom.

1366
01:56:53,044 --> 01:56:54,738
I destroyed two of your teams

1367
01:56:55,580 --> 01:56:57,570
I killed your red headed boyfriend.

1368
01:56:57,747 --> 01:57:00,974
And I put two killers on you
untraceable plane.

1369
01:57:02,419 --> 01:57:04,991
You lost the minute
you interrupted my honeymoon.

1370
01:57:07,958 --> 01:57:10,549
Put a heat-seeker on him now.

1371
01:57:12,528 --> 01:57:13,688
Now!

1372
01:57:24,606 --> 01:57:27,097
That's a goddamn heat seeker
coming at us.

1373
01:57:38,118 --> 01:57:41,080
Oh my...
come and get it.

1374
01:58:02,140 --> 01:58:04,117
Guys!
Dive..

1375
01:58:04,343 --> 01:58:08,074
This... This is for my son!

1376
01:58:26,833 --> 01:58:27,875
Dom!

1377
01:59:30,290 --> 01:59:31,668
You are out of bullets Deckard.

1378
01:59:31,825 --> 01:59:35,093
Like I'm need a gun
to take care of you,

1379
01:59:36,195 --> 01:59:37,219
How did you find me?

1380
01:59:39,231 --> 01:59:42,822
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch!

1381
01:59:46,305 --> 01:59:47,956
Resourceful.

1382
01:59:48,341 --> 01:59:50,043
You have a lot to answer Cipher.

1383
01:59:51,249 --> 01:59:52,649
You pulled my family through.

1384
01:59:53,669 --> 01:59:54,669
A mother.

1385
01:59:56,548 --> 01:59:58,539
I'm gonna make sure
that never happens again.

1386
01:59:58,784 --> 02:00:00,547
To anyone.

1387
02:00:00,852 --> 02:00:03,292
There is only one
flaw in your plan.

1388
02:00:03,362 --> 02:00:04,645
What's that?

1389
02:00:04,656 --> 02:00:06,646
Only one of us has a parachute!

1390
02:00:29,812 --> 02:00:31,346
Told you this would be fun!

1391
02:00:35,251 --> 02:00:37,115
Time to land, Boys!

1392
02:00:47,128 --> 02:00:48,544
You know I've never left you, Letty?

1393
02:00:48,568 --> 02:00:49,568
I know.

1394
02:00:50,398 --> 02:00:52,297
And you know I never will..

1395
02:00:54,301 --> 02:00:55,393
I know.

1396
02:01:04,879 --> 02:01:07,304
I've so much to tell you.

1397
02:01:07,948 --> 02:01:11,025
Yeah you do,
and you can start with that bitch!

1398
02:01:16,122 --> 02:01:20,258
Now, that's...
Dominic Toretto.

1399
02:01:21,427 --> 02:01:25,192
Hey Dom!
I'm just towing it out there?

1400
02:01:25,230 --> 02:01:26,535
We need to get up out of here.

1401
02:01:26,861 --> 02:01:30,108
Cause this all kinda neuclearism
happening under this ice.

1402
02:01:30,369 --> 02:01:33,391
Relax! Without the trigger chips,
those nukes are harmless.

1403
02:01:34,106 --> 02:01:35,364
Ok. So we good then.

1404
02:01:35,841 --> 02:01:38,368
Lemme go and get my
young selfie levels up.

1405
02:01:39,377 --> 02:01:41,368
You realize this is classified, right?

1406
02:01:41,412 --> 02:01:43,209
Not today.

1407
02:01:46,217 --> 02:01:48,254
We have to get up out of here man.
I'm freezing.

1408
02:02:16,412 --> 02:02:17,541
It's Okay.

1409
02:02:18,314 --> 02:02:19,754
Don't worry,
he's gonna be here soon.

1410
02:02:20,617 --> 02:02:22,551
I get it, y'all got a lot in common.

1411
02:02:22,552 --> 02:02:25,035
Computer hacks,
god's eyes, geeks, nerd.

1412
02:02:25,212 --> 02:02:27,798
You know, but we got a
lot in common too! Alright?

1413
02:02:27,898 --> 02:02:29,628
- Like what?
- We walk in the room,

1414
02:02:30,024 --> 02:02:31,951
and we are oozing sex appeal.

1415
02:02:32,151 --> 02:02:34,245
Me and you?
There's a problem.

1416
02:02:34,445 --> 02:02:36,523
I am asking the real
question right now.

1417
02:02:37,131 --> 02:02:38,408
Is it gonna be...

1418
02:02:39,501 --> 02:02:43,484
the Nerd or...
the dark knight?

1419
02:02:44,672 --> 02:02:46,537
To be honest I like both of you.

1420
02:02:46,674 --> 02:02:49,666
A'rigt!
Yeah..yea!

1421
02:02:49,710 --> 02:02:52,433
But just before we
get into all of that,

1422
02:02:52,852 --> 02:02:54,951
Let me ask you one question.

1423
02:02:55,151 --> 02:02:57,674
- You can ask me anything.
- Anything.

1424
02:02:57,984 --> 02:02:59,451
What's my last name?

1425
02:03:01,721 --> 02:03:05,602
When you guys pick around with then
I guess you can let me know.

1426
02:03:05,802 --> 02:03:08,780
It's gonna be a Parker.
That's all that really matters.

1427
02:03:08,803 --> 02:03:09,886
Jones, Miss Parker.

1428
02:03:10,340 --> 02:03:12,001
Hey Miss Parker.

1429
02:03:12,954 --> 02:03:14,418
- Hey.
- Hey.

1430
02:03:15,300 --> 02:03:16,634
I wanted to thank you.

1431
02:03:17,402 --> 02:03:18,402
No need.

1432
02:03:21,156 --> 02:03:22,042
Cipher's still on the loose.

1433
02:03:22,112 --> 02:03:23,631
There's been some
reports she's in Athens.

1434
02:03:23,655 --> 02:03:26,144
But she won't be
nuking any city anytime soon.

1435
02:03:26,344 --> 02:03:27,319
Thanks to you guys.

1436
02:03:27,362 --> 02:03:30,673
- So, I got you a parting favor.
- This can't be good...

1437
02:03:31,199 --> 02:03:35,261
Your record's been clreared.
Full re-instatement. You got you job back.

1438
02:03:35,302 --> 02:03:36,775
That is if you want it.

1439
02:03:40,274 --> 02:03:41,397
If I want?

1440
02:03:49,249 --> 02:03:51,240
You know after 16 years.

1441
02:03:52,218 --> 02:03:53,880
I figured it's time
for a little break.

1442
02:03:53,950 --> 02:03:54,950
Wow.

1443
02:03:56,322 --> 02:03:58,290
Daddy's stayin' home.

1444
02:04:05,197 --> 02:04:07,290
- Nobody.
- Get in touch!

1445
02:04:07,533 --> 02:04:09,293
Ah, hang on a second.

1446
02:04:09,635 --> 02:04:11,295
This could be interesting.

1447
02:04:16,408 --> 02:04:18,327
What made you think
I would do it?

1448
02:04:19,210 --> 02:04:22,445
Brother-hood.
I saw that look you gave Cipher.

1449
02:04:22,545 --> 02:04:24,246
I knew you wanted revenge.

1450
02:04:24,315 --> 02:04:25,503
Glad I did it.

1451
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:31,134
Can't believe you
went to see my Mother.

1452
02:04:41,231 --> 02:04:42,290
Come on.

1453
02:04:47,236 --> 02:04:48,760
All this fuss of you.

1454
02:04:55,077 --> 02:04:56,237
Yes.

1455
02:05:01,583 --> 02:05:04,287
Alena,
I promise to keep our son safe.

1456
02:05:06,826 --> 02:05:08,435
And now.. he always will be.

1457
02:05:17,231 --> 02:05:19,222
I want to introduce
you to the most

1458
02:05:19,292 --> 02:05:21,114
important person in my universe.

1459
02:05:22,736 --> 02:05:25,203
Who will never give up on me.

1460
02:05:33,981 --> 02:05:35,140
You've heard me say.

1461
02:05:35,902 --> 02:05:38,210
"That you never turn
your back on family."

1462
02:05:40,152 --> 02:05:44,282
And I wanna thank you all
for never turning your back on me.

1463
02:05:48,828 --> 02:05:50,321
You wanna meet them?

1464
02:05:51,329 --> 02:05:53,194
Alright!

1465
02:05:53,565 --> 02:05:54,565
Everyone...

1466
02:05:56,183 --> 02:05:57,497
Meet Bryan.

1467
02:06:06,611 --> 02:06:07,714
Hey Bryan.

1468
02:06:10,119 --> 02:06:12,308
Okay,
I guess he's my turning secret.

1469
02:06:13,323 --> 02:06:15,139
<i>Thank you for giving us family.</i>

1470
02:06:18,693 --> 02:06:20,199
<i>Thank you for giving
us the strength.</i>

1471
02:06:23,229 --> 02:06:38,229
