MARKHAM: Carter Verone.

134
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,250
Born in Argentina, but he's
lived most of his life in Miami.

135
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,837
Now he owns the biggest
import-export business in the state.

136
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,381
You see, unfortunately, the
cartels have been successful

137
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,925
getting drugs into Miami.

138
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,260
But they've had a hard time
getting the cash out.

139
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,095
We've been surveilling him
for a year.

140
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,848
But we've never been able to
put him and the money together.

141
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,601
- We've swept his house, his warehouses...
- Nothing.

142
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,063
Customs here has done a
great job of getting us this far.

143
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,148
I'm just here to help
get them over the top.

144
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,651

an agent in undercover,

145
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,945
working travel
and logistics for him.

146
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,739
Recently Verone put her in
charge of finding some new drivers.

147
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,284
Right, although we can't
confirm her status right now.

148
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:19,121
- You think she's flipped?
- She's one of mine. She's all right.

149
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:23,292
She's been in with Verone nearly a year.
Even lives at the compound with him now.

150
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:27,505
Look, it was the FBI's idea to
bring you in here. I'm against it.

151
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:31,676
But we need some good drivers that can
put this asshole and his money together.

152
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,178
You're gonna roll
with Agent Dunn here.

153

And if I don't?

154

Here's a list of the
laws you broke in L.A.

155

Obstruction of justice, aiding and
abetting. You know the rap sheet.

156

159
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:56,659
So what's the idea here? Dunn and
I are supposed to be street racers?

160
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,994
That's right.

161
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,251
So, Dunn,

162
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,590
looks like we're
going to be partners, bro.

163
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,633
Could you tell me, what
would be a better motor

164
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,303
for my Skyline,
a Gallo 12 or a Gallo 24?

165
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,767
Twenty four.

166
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,313
I didn't know
pizza places made motors.

167
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,318
See, man, come on,
I can't do this.

168
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,570
I mean, seriously, if this
is what you're gonna give me,

169
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,114
I may as well
take my chances in Chino.

170
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,825
BILKINS: We'll get
someone else.

171
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,286
BRIAN: No way, man.

172
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,625
The only way I'll do this is
if I get to pick the driver.

173
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,837
All right, O'Conner.
Who you got in mind?

174
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,715
This dude I grew up with
in Barstow.

175
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,008
Who's that?

176
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,093
Roman Pearce.

177
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,245
- That your boy in the Monte Carlo?
- BRIAN: Yeah, that's him.

178
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,540
Yeah, he's got some skills.

179
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,710
And he's crazy as hell,
I'm telling you.

180
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,922
In a good way, though.
He's the man for the job.

181
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,597
And he's got quite a record,
including three years upstate.

182
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,100
Says here,
he's on house arrest now.

183
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,769
Can't go more than
100 yards from his home.

184
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,851
He always said
he'd be famous.

185
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,648
BRIAN: Pearce!

186
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,317
Roman Pearce!

187
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,280
Yo, whatever happens next,
just let it go.

188
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,781
I ain't in it.

189
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,161
Rome!

190
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,794
Only my homeboys
call me Rome,

191
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,379
pig.

192
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,386
- I'm not a cop anymore, bro.
- Is that true?

193
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,515
Blondie here
is not a cop anymore?

194
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,517
That's true. No badge.

195
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,031
BILKINS: Here we go.

196
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,462
You still fight like shit.
You still fight like shit.

197
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,672
You better chill.

198
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,259
- What the hell are you doing here?
- BRIAN: I'm gonna choke you.

199
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,470
I told you to
stay away from me.

200
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,894
You should have told me.
I did three years, Brian.

201
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,687
I told you it wasn't my fault.

202
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,658
Why did you come here,
O'Conner?

203
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,247
I got a deal for you.

204
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:18,254
When I needed your ass,
you were nowhere to be found.

205
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,216
Now you're trying to
hand out deals?

206
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,555
I need you to come to Miami
and drive with me.

207
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,975
If you do, they'll take off that anklet
and they'll clear your entire record.

208
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,185
I did three years in jail.

209
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,980
Three years in jail
over you, Brian.

210
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,524
I know you
better than you think.

211
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,817
Maybe you don't.

212
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,443
Maybe you don't.

213
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,863
You guys finished?

214
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,282
This deal legit?

215
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,410
That's right.
If you do this job for us.

216
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:50,995
I told you.

217
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,413
Shut up, punk.

218
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,791
So you're gonna
clean my record

219
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,668
and get this thing
off my ankle.

220
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,044
That's right.

221
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,882
I thought you couldn't wander
more than 100 yards from your home.

222
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,467
Why do you think I'm
parked so close to the derby?

223
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,887
Man, quit playing like
you're gonna pass this up.

224
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,098
You stupid...

225
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,046
Wait. Hold on.

226
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,133
Bro, what's going on?

227
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,553
I don't know if
I should be trusting you, man.

228
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,434
Just think of it this way. It's
an opportunity for a fresh start.

229
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,769
Now, let's just go do this,
all right?

230
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,897
I wouldn't need a fresh start
if it wasn't for you.

231
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,399
Man, you've been using that
since the day you got busted.

232
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,109
Now, let's just chill out
and go do this.

233
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,903
I don't need to chill out.

234
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,196
Yes, you do.

235
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,323
And you need to stop blaming
me for your every mistake.

236
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:12,701
And Roman Pearce needs to start
taking responsibility for his own actions.

237
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,078
You need to go to hell.

238
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,246
And you need to
go back to Barstow.

239
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,126
I'm not going back to Barstow.

240
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:35,391
Brian O'Conner, Roman Pearce,
meet Monica Fuentes.

241
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,976
Do they have background
on Verone?

242
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,060
They've been briefed.

243
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,604
Good. All right,
here's the deal.

244
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:43,774
Verone's looking for drivers. I've
arranged for both of you to join up.

245
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,151
I've also hired some thugs,
you know, to make it legit.

246
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,404
- When do we start?
- Right now.

247
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,155
What are we driving?

248
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:00,624
Don't even think about
taking the convertible.

249
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,751
It might
loosen your mousse.

250
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,587
That's cool. That's too
much chrome for me anyways.

251
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:10,300
Damn! Where do you all
confiscate these rims from, man?

252
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,262
Check in with us
after you meet him.

253
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,765
You think you're gonna have any
problems with these two knuckleheads?

254
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:17,891
I can handle them.

255
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,810
If they give you any trouble
at all, you let me know.

256
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,311
Thanks, Markham.

257
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,025
I ride with you, cowboy.

258
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,444
Why she gotta ride with you?

259
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,612
You get the convertible.
Let's go.

260
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,211
Turn right here.

261
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,594
- So, you used to be a cop?
- Yeah.

262
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,014
How long you been under?

263
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,183
I lost track.

264
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,310
You all right?

265
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,398
You might want to keep
your eyes on the road, playboy.

266
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,317
What, you think
we're gonna crash?

267
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,194
I haven't decided yet.

268
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,492
What are you doing, Brian?

269
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:29,713
He did the "stare and drive" on
you, didn't he? He got that from me.

270
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,376
MONICA: Once we get in here,
you're on your own.

271
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,722
Look at that one.

272
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:24,393
Where'd you get them cars?
At the bottom of a cereal box?

273
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,689
Real funny, Fonzie.

274
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,233
ASS.

275
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,236
Roberto, Enrique, I need
pictures of the drivers,

276
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:37,322
their license plates, their cars,
and anything else you can find.

277
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,074
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

278
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,545
Let's go.

279
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,050
Keep your mouth shut
and follow my lead, all right?

280
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,011
I got this.

281
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,096
No, I'm serious now.

282
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,932
Handle your business.
I'll handle mine.

283
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,893
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

284
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,688
Watch your hands, bruh.

285
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:13,942
ENRIQUE: Go in line.

286
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,652
Let's go.

287
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,954
Carter.

288
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,422
- The drivers are here.
- Good.

289
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:36,924
Come on.

290
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,304
Stay.

291
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,097
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

292
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,683
What's going on here, bro?
Tell me.

293
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,229
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

294
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,690
My red Ferrari
was confiscated yesterday

295
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:56,318
and it sits in an impound lot
in Little Haiti.

296
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,654
It's about 20 miles from here.

297
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,656
The car isn't important.
What is important

298
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,158
is the package I left
in the glove box.

299
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,661
The first team back here
with the package

300
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,829
will have an opportunity
to work for me.

301
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,082
What are you saying?
We got to audition?

302
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,334
Nobody's got a gun
to your head.

303
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,046
That's it.

304
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,383
Driver's licenses.
Pass them up.

305
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:22,719
Before Christmas, guys.

306
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,346
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

307
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,516
Let's go!

308
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,537
Come on, cuz!

309
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,875
All right, let's see
what this thing can do.

310
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,894
Agent Markham. I've got
them heading south on I-95.

311
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,313
Yeah, I got it.

312
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,232
They're running.
What a surprise.

313
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,578
Come on, stick with me, Rome.
What you got?

314
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,088
Why must I chase the cat?

315
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:55,729
Smart-ass.

316
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,155
Oh, yeah, you think
you're the bomb, Rome?

317
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,655
Let's see
if you still got it, Brian.

318
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,575
All right, Rome,
I got something for your ass.

319
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,333
Watch this, bro.

320
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,301
Shit.

321
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,847
Damn, Rome,
how do you like them apples?

322
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,014
Show-off!

323
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,685
That's the Brian O'Conner
school of driving right there, baby!

324
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,941
Crazy-ass white boy!

325
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,235
Shit!

326
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,849
RASTA: Bumbaclot.

327
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,020
WOMAN: You better get yourself
out of the street!

328
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,813
That's some bad shit, man.

329
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,782
What do we got?

330
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,746
That's good.
Show me his partner.

331
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,335
Cars, cars.
Where are the cars?

332
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,301
Stinking boats.
Where are the cars?

333
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,648
Come on, I need the cars.
Where are the cars at?

334
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,264
- Look in the center. Look in the center.
- What?

335
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,059
Cha-ching!

336
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,687
- Now put your blouse back on.
- Hater.

337
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,905
PEARCE: Shit!

338
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,579
- Don't let him get away.
- Not a problem.

339
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,831
Sit on it, Fonzie!

340
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,041
What the hell?

341
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,668
Shit. Cops.

342
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,878
What the hell
are they doing here?

343
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,297
BRIAN: Rome, no!

344
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,051
Time to go.

345
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:00,724
Son of a bitch!

346
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,060
MONICA: Juvy record for
popping cars. Two years in J.D.

347
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,938
Then another year for aiding
and abetting an armed robbery.

348
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,774
<i>He's clean.
Dirty, but clean.</i>

349
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,861
All right.

350
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,801
Hey, man. You got something
to eat up in there?

351
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,803
We hungry.

352
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,768
Sit them by the pool.

353
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,103
Nice. Come on.

354
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,239
What are you
checking her out for?

355
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,241
I'm not checking her out.

356
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,246
Yes, you were.

357
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,956
No, I wasn't.

358
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,167
I seen you
checking her out, man.

359
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,669
Okay, I was. Now shut up.

360
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,380
You shut up.
Don't tell me to shut up.

361
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,675
Both you girlies shut up.
Unbelievable.

362
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,431
Good.

363
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,897
You sure are cozy
in this big old mansion.

364
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,318
Sleeping with the enemy.

365
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,492
No, no, no, no. Sit down.

366
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,287
Nice Ferrari you got
in the driveway.

367
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,208
I'm glad you like it.

368
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,756
Darling,
will you hold that?

369
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,684
We did all that
for a damn cigar?

370
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,478
No. You did that for a job.

371
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,072
Do you really think that I would
let somebody impound my car?

372
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,953
The boatyard is mine.

373
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,206
By the way,
you two owe me a gate.

374
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,500
I'll just take it
off your cut.

375
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,172
- Off our cut?
- Yeah.

376
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,341
- I like that.
- Good.

377
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,344
What's this job you
got for us, anyway?

378
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,596
Come with me.

379
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,514
The house has ears in it.

380
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:52,520
I have something I want you to
carry from North Beach to the Keys.

381
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:53,813
What is it?

382
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,107
Just put in the car what I
tell you to and drive it to me

383
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,026
and don't let anybody
stop you. Understand?

384
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,695
Yeah. Any chance
of cop trouble?

385
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,071
No, I'm buying you
a window of time

386
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,657
but it's not gonna
be open very long.

387
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,077
You make it,

388
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,665
and I'll personally hand you
$100,000 at the finish line.

389
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:15,502
Make it $100,000
apiece, papi.

390
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,214
Look, man,

391
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,508
obviously

392
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,052
your pockets
ain't nervous.

393
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,428
Hey, hey.

394
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,431
- Don't ever touch me.
- Ours are empty.

395
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,684
Like I said,

396
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,728
we hungry.

397
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,032
I got an idea.
Why don't you two boys

398
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,243
join us at the club
a little later tonight?

399
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,203
Yeah.
Pearl at midnight?

400
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,372
Get to know each
other a little bit better.

401
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,040
That sounds good.

402
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,001
- We'll see you tonight.
- See you.

403
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,131
Hey, you!

404
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,804
- Your pockets aren't empty.
- Damn.

405
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,139
I'll take my cutter back.

406
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,439
Stupid ass.

407
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,570
Hey, man, I figured you
had like 12 or 13 of these.

408
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,779
You're not too bright,
are you?

409
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,406
Just get out of here.
Get out of here.

410
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,950
Same old Rome doing
the same old stupid shit.

411
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,285
Get off me, man.

412
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:34,455
Look, running your mouth? Insulting
people? Stealing Verone's shit?

413
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,208
You think I'm gonna let
somebody stare me down?

414
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:40,044
I didn't let nobody stare
me down in jail, homeboy.

415
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,630
You think I'm gonna
let it fly on a beach?

416
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,967
"And you,
I'll take my cutter back."

417
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,802
His rich ass.

418
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,138
And you're packing.

419
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,598
Like you ain't.

420
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,893
Exactly.

421
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,561
From here on out,
I do the talking.

422
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,813
You want to do
more than that.

423
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,315
What's that supposed to mean?

424
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:04,277
It means you're always getting
in trouble over a female, Brian.

425
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,081
BRIAN: Man, Tej's garage
is ridiculous.

426
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,625
He's got the best
of everything.

427
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,335
Snap-on tools.
All these lifts are brand new.

428
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,004
They're only maybe
a couple of months old.

429
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,797
Hey, yo, Jimmy.
What's up, man?

430
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,174
JIMMY: Hey,
what up, Bullitt?

431
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,884
That's Rome right there.
Do me a favor.

432
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,511
When you get a second, I want
you to check out the Evo and Spyder.

433
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,638
Make sure
everything's copasetic.

434
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,598
Evo? Where'd you
get an Evo from?

435
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,975
- It's a long story.
- I got you, man.

436
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,769
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Come check this out.

437
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,855
Man, it's so hot and humid,
I can't even wear drawers.

438
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,649
Man, tell me about it.

439
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,818
Look at all this potential
out here.

440
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,197
<i>Ray, don't do that, man.
You're making me lose money.</i>

441
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:53,326
<i>Come on, stop that. I know
you're better than that. Come on.</i>

442
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,204
Damn.

443
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,886
Girl, you know your boy can help you put
that fire out! Look at the bubble on that.

444
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,889
- Let's go.
- That's serious.

445
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,724
<i>Come on, Ray, you're
making me lose money.</i>

446
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:19,394
<i>Don't do that. Don't
do that to me right now.</i>

447
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,145
<i>Come on, Ray. Do it.</i>

448
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,983
Tej Parker?
This is Roman Pearce.

449
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,237
Basically, he's the
man to know in Miami.

450
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,572
He's got his finger
in absolutely everything.

451
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,866
- It's just the way it is.
- <i>Come home to daddy. Come on now.</i>

452
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,743
- What's going on, Suki?
- What's up, baby?

453
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:37,328
- How you doing?
- I'm good. How you doing?

454
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,122
What's this?
What's the latest?

455
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,251
It's a work in progress.
It's not finished yet.

456
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,962
That's some artistic shit.
You got talent, girl.

457
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:49,424
<i>Ray, it's do or die right now! Bring
it home, Ray! Bring it home, Ray!</i>

458
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,468
<i>Yeah, baby!</i>

459
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,429
<i>Pay up! Pay up! Pay up!</i>

460
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:55,847
<i>Pay up, everybody.</i>

461
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,598
That's how they
do it out here, man?

462
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,851
- Every day.
- That's crazy.

463
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,187
<i>Right here. Right now. What's
up, man? You don't look too happy.</i>

464
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:07,734
<i>Expeditiously, man. I need it quick.
What's up? Thank you. Thank you.</i>

465
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:11,946
<i>How you feeling, man?
You all right? Thank you.</i>

466
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,116
Not too bad.

467
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:20,788
I see you're about your
money, homey. You race, too?

468
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:26,419
No, man. I hit a wall doing like
a buck 20 a couple years ago.

469
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,589
Ever since then, I've just been
organizing and collecting, man.

470
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,799
Hey, Tej, check it out. He's
gonna be in town for a while.

471
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,676
Is there any way he
could use that cot?

472
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,597
- What's wrong with your place, man?
- No.

473
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:41,267
I don't want to stay with
him. He got bad habits.

474
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:46,731
All right, man, whatever. Show him
around. I'll be up there in a minute.

475
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,149
- Thanks.
- Sure.

476
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,986
<i>All right, who wants a chance
to win their money back?</i>

477
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,990
So, Jimmy? So, what's up, you
ever seen anything like this before?

478
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:59,535
No. Both of them are wired
like I never seen before.

479
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:00,787
What?

480
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,830
Yeah, man, they got
us wired with GPS.

481
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:05,917
That's why Markham knew we
were gonna be at that impound lot.

482
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:10,213
Yo, you the master mechanic.
Why don't you just yank that shit out?

483
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,757
I'll try,
but this ain't LoJack.

484
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:16,844
The DIS box, the engine management
system, hell, the main harness,

485
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,846
the GPS is spidered
into all of that.

486
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,473
Hey, tell me something, man.

487
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,017
Do I even want to know
where the Skyline is, dawg?

488
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:25,019
Or where you've been
the past couple of days

489
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,021
or where the hell
you got these rides from?

490
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,649
- They're hot.
- Yeah, they hot.

491
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,859
They wired so hot that
whoever's tracking these things

492
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:34,237
would know every time
you don't wear your seat belt.

493
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,199
All right, Jimmy.

494
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,743
- Just do what you can do, bro.
- I got you.

495
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,203
Thanks, man.

496
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,956
Man, we need to get
these on the street ASAP.

497
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,708
Hey, bro, check it out.

498
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:50,711
See that Cadillac across
the street over there?

499
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,508
Yeah.

500
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,427
Yeah, well, they've been on us
ever since we left Verone's house.

501
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,894
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

502
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,148
Elian and Fidel!

503
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,735
Hey, man, can I clean
your windshield, buddy?

504
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,654
What are you doing, man?

505
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,573
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

506
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:20,825
PEARCE: Is everything
copastetic, homey?

507
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,577
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

508
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,453
Kiss my ass.

509
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,039
Shit.

510
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,419
PEARCE: Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

511
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:35,298
(CURSING IN SPANISH)

512
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:39,760
He's gonna blow our cover
before we even get started.

513
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,305
Bilkins, tell me
what went wrong?

514
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,556
That's what
I want to know.

515
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,600
Show me your hands.
Come on, keep them up!

516
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,060
- What's this about, man?
- What's going on?

517
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:51,272
Hold this. You think you can shoot
at me? I'm a goddamn federal agent.

518
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:52,481
What are you talking about?

519
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:55,568
- Get your damn hands off me!
- Get him away from me, dawg!

520
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,863
Just 'cause you wear a badge doesn't
mean you can mess shit up for us, homeboy!

521
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,615
Get your hands off me!

522
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,909
- You're lucky I didn't shoot you
- Shut up!

523
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,619
Don't tell me to shut up,
Brian!

524
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,163
- You almost blew our cover, old man!
- I'm right here.

525
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,165
You shouldn't have
shown up like you did.

526
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,292
You didn't know
Verone was testing us?

527
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,461
- No, I thought you punks were running!
- Running?

528
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,838
That's great.
That's real great!

529
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:19,759
And if Rome wanted to shoot
you? You wouldn't be here right now.

530
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,637
All right, we got to
get this under control.

531
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,060
That's mine!

532
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,394
So?

533
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:32,480
Tell me what you know.

534
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,982
Rome and I will be
making a run for Verone.

535
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,901
I'm not sure when or where,

536
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,819
but he did say that
he bought us a window,

537
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,446
I'm assuming
from the local cops.

538
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,990
I can talk to some of
the guys at the local P.D.

539
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:46,160
No. No good. If Verone's got
some of them on the payroll,

540
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,496
then we can't let them
know our operation.

541
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,872
Exactly.

542
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:54,377
In addition, Verone told us that he
himself would be waiting at the drop.

543
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,254
That's good news.

544
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,589
If you're gonna be
delivering drug money to him,

545
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,508
then we can get
him for laundering.

546
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,969
- Now, there's only one problem.
- What's that?

547
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,345
Fuentes.

548
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,013
Verone's tapping her.

549
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:07,098
Tapping her?

550
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,267
- Tapping her how?
- That is crap.

551
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,727
Now what you talking about,
homeboy? We know what we seen.

552
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,437
So what do you think,
O'Conner?

553
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,856
You think she's compromised?
You should know.

554
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:17,566
What's that
supposed to mean?

555
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,735
Your old pal O'Conner
didn't tell you?

556
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:21,862
He flipped on
Bilkins in L.A.

557
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:24,865
He gave his mark his car
keys and let him disappear.

558
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,285
That's why
he's not a cop anymore.

559
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,330
So what do you think,
expert?

560
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,041
Man, I don't know.

561
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,627
All right. We'll
keep an eye on her.

562
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,880
We're out of here.

563
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:48,347
Let your man go?

564
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,641
Drop it. I don't
wanna talk about it.

565
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:53,561
Drop it, hell. I want to
hear about this, homey.

566
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,730
I said, forget about it, cuz.

567
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,982
We got Fuentes
in with Verone,

568
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,651
Markham trying
to blow our cover,

569
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:04,864
and we got two wired cars that are no better
than that damn ankle bracelet of mine.

570
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,115
I'm gonna tell you, bruh,

571
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:09,201
you let Markham do that
shit again in front of Verone,

572
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,578
that's gonna be our ass!

573
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,705
I know, man. I know. It's
just getting thick real quick.

574
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:15,708
We may need a way out, we got to
come up with some kind of an exit strategy.

575
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,668
- Exit strategy?
- Yeah.

576
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:23,007
I like the way that sounds.
What you got in mind?

577
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,093
I don't know, man. But
we need two more cars.

578
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,894
Yeah. Here they come.

579
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:57,875
Fonzie and Fabio.
Glad you can join us.

580
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,629
We heard you boys wanted to
get rid of those Cracker Jack toys.

581
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,631
No, actually we just
figured those cars you got

582
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,801
deserve better drivers, which is why
we're gonna take them off your hands.

583
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,302
You know, why don't
we settle this now?

584
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:11,138
Wait, wait, wait. How about
we settle this on the blacktop?

585
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:15,309
Each car does a down-and-back,
tag-team style. For slips.

586
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,061
Loser walks home.

587
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,772
- We came to race.
- Load them up then.

588
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:25,444
Come on, bro,
let's get these cars.

589
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:30,825
All right, check it out. There's no way
we're gonna beat these guys straight up.

590
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,327
That Hemi's putting out
about 425

591
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,789
and that Yenko will snap a
speedo in about five seconds flat.

592
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,583
We're gonna have to pull
something out of our ass.

593
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,253
The only thing I can think of is
save the spray for the way back.

594
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,337
The return trip.

595
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,006
- Done deal.
- All right, let's do this, bro.

596
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,008
I'm getting
that orange one.

597
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,054
You ain't ready, Fabio!

598
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:57,935
TEJ: All right.

599
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,522
You each got a barrel to go around
down at the end of the road here.

600
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:05,484
Second wave's got to sit tight till
your partner crosses this line right here.

601
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:08,571
First team to go down and
back twice wins the race.

602
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,698
At which point,

603
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:15,411
the losers will
hand over them keys.

604
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:19,039
Otherwise you'll be eating
breakfast through straws from now on.

605
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,208
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

606
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:23,752
I get it.

607
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,881
This means you, too.

608
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,216
I got it.

609
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:31,343
All right. Let's race.

610
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,934
Come on, baby, you got this,
Rome! This dude ain't serious.

611
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:42,521
Yeah, you gone, homey.
I got this. This is done.

612
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,566
You about to lose your car.

613
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,735
- Do it, Rome!
- Come on, bitch, you got it, man.

614
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:51,989
You think I'm worried about
this fool, man? This is nothing!

615
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,960
- Oh, no.
- American muscle.

616
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:10,591
Your engine ain't
as big as your mouth.

617
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:18,432
Got to smoke him. Got to
smoke him, got to smoke him.

618
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:19,808
All right, here we go!

619
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,937
- It's all right, baby, I'm gonna handle this.
- Handle it.

620
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:26,774
Ready, and go!

621
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,075
You ain't ready!
I run these streets!

622
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:48,295
Romey Rome!
You ain't heard of me?

623
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,565
Oh, shit.

624
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,445
Oh, yeah!

625
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:20,869
I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you.

626
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,206
Where's your big mouth now?

627
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,166
That car's going home with me,
homey.

628
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,722
Shit. Eat this, sucker!

629
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,070
Shit!

630
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,952
Yeah, boy! Go, Korpi!

631
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:08,042
Sorry, blondie,
how does that dust taste?

632
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,879
I don't know.

633
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,381
Come on, Rome.

634
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:44,328
What the...

635
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,414
Good move, kid. Let's see
if you got the balls. Come on.

636
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,826
Come on, Brian,
bring it home, man!

637
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,495
We got two new cars!

638
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:10,998
Damn!

639
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:21,175
Y'all ain't ready, homeboy!
Get to walking, Fabio!

640
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,595
Use them bus tokens,
partner!

641
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,229
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good. What's your name?

642
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:35,689
We're guests of Mr. Verone's.

643
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,993
It's a hoasis in here, bruh.

644
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:51,163
Yeah, lots of potential.

645
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:55,042
Damn. You got a pen?

646
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,506
It's about to get serious,
bruh.

647
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:03,550
PEARCE: Look at that girl
on the swing right there.

648
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:05,344
Hey, you guys
did something right.

649
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,721
Verone never socializes
with hired help.

650
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:09,973
Now what's that make you?

651
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,518
- Where's he at?
- He's on his way.

652
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,728
You and Verone don't
go everywhere together?

653
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,523
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

654
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,987
- I'm gonna go take a piss.
- You go do that.

655
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,077
What is his deal?

656
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,412
He doesn't trust people
who carry badges.

657
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,498
So you talk
like you know.

658
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,419
I'd been a cop
about two months

659
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:41,672
when Roman was busted
in a garage raid.

660
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:45,676
He had eight sets of wheels in his
possession, each one of them hot.

661
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,511
So you busted him?

662
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:49,805
No, I didn't even know
it was going down.

663
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,932
But that doesn't
really matter to him.

664
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:55,269
Basically,
once I became a cop,

665
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,980
Roman saw me as a friend
who became the enemy.

666
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:07,030
Is there anything I can
get for you, Mr. Verone?

667
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,157
Just tell them
to come join me.

668
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,708
Oh, yeah.
I was admiring this.

669
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:28,802
Damn.

670
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,597
- I wasn't about to give it to you.
- Good.

671
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,056
- What's up?
- He's here, man.

672
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:35,517
Where's he at?

673
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,644
He's over there. Don't look.

674
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,484
Excuse me, Mr. Verone
would like for you to join him.

675
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:46,612
Let's do it.

676
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:49,448
See what I'm talking about?

677
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,578
It's all right, let them in.

678
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:59,374
Go sit down, I'll talk
to you in a second.

679
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,753
- How you doing?
- Good. Enjoying your night?

680
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,172
- Yeah, I'm having a good time.
- Good, good.

681
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,384
She's beautiful, isn't she?

682
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:17,184
Yeah.

683
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:19,811
She's gorgeous.

684
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,195
You got balls, kid.

685
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:30,989
I can appreciate that.

686
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,076
Women are
a very powerful force.

687
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:39,373
You see the blonde sitting
with the gentleman right here?

688
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:47,589
Five minutes of her time, and she
can get anything she wants from him.

689
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,549
I love your hair.

690
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,842
Watch.

691
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:59,685
I wonder where they're going?
Sit down.

692
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:05,357
So you lit my man's car
on fire. Is that right?

693
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,318
Yeah.

694
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:10,570
I did.

695
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:15,575
You see, I got a
problem with authority.

696
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,871
I have that same problem.

697
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:24,126
For me,
it's cops in particular.

698
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,265
Let's take a walk. Come on.

699
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:41,268
- We just got here.
- And now we're leaving.

700
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,520
Let's go.

701
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:53,780
Come on.

702
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,055
What's all that?

703
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,559
We're going to have
a little fun.

704
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,026
MONICA: Thank you.

705
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:36,198
- It'll be fun. Let's stay longer.
- Let's get out of here.

706
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,535
Hey, Carter.

707
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:43,121
Meet Detective Whitworth.

708
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,167
One of Miami's finest.

709
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,836
Thank you, sweetheart.

710
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,713
You enjoying yourself,
Detective?

711
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:53,256
Yeah, I was.

712
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:56,343
I mean, you know me.

713
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:57,886
Yeah.

714
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,013
I do know you.

715
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,725
You've been on my payroll
a long time.

716
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:06,394
- Verone, that ain't right.
- Shut up.

717
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:11,066
I've got one last job for you,
Detective. You hear me?

718
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,485
- Look, we've been all through this.
- Yeah?

719
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,403
Yeah, and I said
I can't do it.

720
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,991
That's the wrong answer.
The table.

721
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,624
I'm a detective, Verone!

722
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:31,795
You do anything to me, the whole
force is gonna be on your ass in a minute.

723
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:35,132
Shut your mouth,
you fat piece of shit.

724
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,467
Stop right now.

725
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:45,392
What the hell?
What the hell is that?

726
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,768
Sit down.

727
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:50,147
You're going to regret this.
Stop right now!

728
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:53,024
Once the bucket
gets hot enough, Detective,

729
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,777
the rat is gonna want out.

730
01:00:57,362 --> 01:01:00,198
And the only direction
it can go, is south.

731
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:05,829
Hold that.

732
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,873
Get it off me!

733
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,417
Shut up.

734
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:16,006
Did you know that your average rat
can chew through a steel drainpipe?

735
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,510
You see, you have nothing to worry
about when he's screaming, Detective.

736
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:23,305
It's when he goes quiet
that he goes to work.

737
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:26,433
WHITWORTH: Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!

738
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,895
You can't be this stupid!
Stop it now!

739
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:33,440
You're in charge of the units
that are watching my properties.

740
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,568
What I want is,
I want a 15-minute window

741
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:39,362
where everybody, and I mean
everybody, disappears. You hear me?

742
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,948
- I can't do it!
- You can't?

743
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,285
WHITWORTH: Stop it.

744
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,704
Okay. Monica, come here.

745
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,248
WHITWORTH: Help! Help!

746
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:51,791
Shut him up. Shut him up.

747
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,628
Help!

748
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,297
Help!

749
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,177
It's biting me!

750
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:05,096
What?

751
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,226
Got something you want to say?

752
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,687
It bit me. Jesus.

753
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:16,316
- WHITWORTH: I'll do it!
- Do what? Say it.

754
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,152
I'll do it.
I'll give you your window.

755
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:21,905
WHITWORTH: Just get it off me.

756
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,365
Get it off!

757
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,202
You betray me,

758
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,829
and my rat here

759
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:33,124
is gonna visit
your wife, Lynn,

760
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:36,336
your son, Clay,
and your daughter, Lexi.

761
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:39,005
Do you hear me?
Do you understand me?

762
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:40,966
- You hear me?
- Get it off.

763
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:44,010
I'll burn your fucking
eyes out! I'll burn them out.

764
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:49,474
Now, you can go.

765
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:53,144
- Get rid of him. Let's go.
- Get it off.

766
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:04,531
You boys enjoy the show?

767
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:08,785
Fifteen minutes, and then every
cop in Florida's gonna be on you.

768
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:12,706
Be at Versailles Cafe at 6:00 a.m.,
day after tomorrow, ready to drive.

769
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,708
- You understand?
- Yeah.

770
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,793
Don't play games with me

771
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:19,796
or you'll be next. All right?

772
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:23,383
Help yourself to a little
champagne. Let's go.

773
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,346
That was a damn rat, man.

774
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:42,527
You ever touch another
man again, and I'll kill you.

775
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:44,195
You hear me?

776
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,657
Look at me. You hear me?

777
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,667
She was into it, man.
What's that about?

778
01:03:58,293 --> 01:04:00,879
You seen the way she
grabbed the dude's head.

779
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,505
She had to, man.
He was testing her.

780
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:05,550
You got to remember, her
ass is on the line, just like ours.

781
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:08,428
You're feeling this girl
way too much.

782
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:12,265
She's like that crazy-ass trailer
rat from back in the day, Tanya.

783
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:15,435
Tanya? Man, you went
out with her after I did.

784
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:18,772
I mean, I couldn't
let it go to waste.

785
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,774
JIMMY: I got you. I got you.
I got you.

786
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,317
Is that right?

787
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,278
We go race for cash,
but when I step on the gas,

788
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:28,573
my nitrous go blast,
leave your ass in the past.

789
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,909
Tej, you about to
lose your garage.

790
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,410
Whatever, man.

791
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:35,121
I'm a low-budget mechanic,
but I overcharge.

792
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:38,041
Pay me! Let's go, man.

793
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,001
Pay me my money.
I told you, man.

794
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:43,546
I'm glad you're happy man. I'm
so glad. This is my garage, boy.

795
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:46,091
Royal flush.
Give me this, man.

796
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:48,009
You got to talk to him,
talk to him.

797
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:49,969
Damn, you can't play
and play it for long.

798
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:52,847
Put that money back on the
table. You know it's mine next hand.

799
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:55,934
Jimmy, how are you gonna pay me
back if you keep losing to Tej like that?

800
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,143
- How you doing, bro?
- Real good.

801
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,938
I'm going to crash, Tej.
I'll catch you tomorrow.

802
01:05:16,538 --> 01:05:17,872
What are you doing here?

803
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:21,835
Brian, they're gonna Kill you. I
heard him telling Enrique and Roberto.

804
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:25,046
Once you finish the run, they're
putting a bullet in your head.

805
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,215
You sure you heard him right?

806
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,926
I'm sure. I'm sure.

807
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:38,226
Verone's boys is outside...

808
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:41,771
I see what they're looking
for. Your little girlfriend here.

809
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:48,903
They don't know I'm here.
I snuck out.

810
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:50,447
What the hell are
they doing here then?

811
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,532
I don't know.
Maybe they're guessing.

812
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,452
Go stall them. Go stall
them for, like, two minutes.

813
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:57,787
Check her, homey.
Check her.

814
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,627
Found what you're
looking for?

815
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:12,051
Hey, buddy.
Hi, guys. How you doing?

816
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,097
Y'all still mad
about y'all car?

817
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:19,058
Don't even trip, homey. Come
on, man, can't you take a joke?

818
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:23,062
All right, this isn't about being a
good cop anymore or doing your job.

819
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:25,106
They're gonna Kill you.
You guys gotta pull out.

820
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,442
Verone pay y'all to keep
a straight face like that?

821
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:31,571
'Cause if I was making money, shit, I'd
get that mole removed off my damn nose.

822
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,698
- Okay?
- Yeah.

823
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,909
How much he pay y'all anyway?

824
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:39,579
Every time I see y'all, man,
y'all got the silk shirts on,

825
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,998
jewelry, you know,
looking real Miami.

826
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:44,417
I caught you
walking up in the club,

827
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:46,961
you got the hamburger meat
all hanging out.

828
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,424
Don't make that run, Brian.
Don't make that run.

829
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:53,676
Be careful.

off my homeboy's boat.

It's over. Come on.

844
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:10,378
VERONE: It's over. Let's go.

845
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,673
It's our gun.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

846
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:21,681
I'm glad to see you boys
are getting along so well

because tomorrow, Roberto and
Enrique are gonna be riding along with you.

848

Just so we don't
have any problems.

849
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:31,065
I'll see you guys in a bit.

850
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:37,196
What the hell was she
doing in there, man?

851
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:49,959
Where'd you go this morning?

852
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:52,754
I went to breakfast
with some friends.

853
01:08:58,468 --> 01:08:59,969
With friends?

854
01:09:02,013 --> 01:09:04,098
I do have friends, Carter.

855
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:11,814
Okay.

856
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,401
I'll see you later.

857
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,162
Nice shirt, Bilkins.

858
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,164
- It's my day off.
- Yeah.

859
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,709
Well, anyhow,
this is the deal.

860
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:35,588
Last night, Verone threatened
a cop into giving us a window.

861
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:39,175
We're driving to an airstrip in
the Keys, off Nallwood Avenue.

862
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,552
Verone has a plane there
and he's taking off for good.

863
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,471
Wait a minute.
How do you know this?

864
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,181
Monica.

865
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,309
She's doing her job.
She warned us.

866
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:49,936
She warned you about what?

867
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:52,480
Verone plans to kill us
after we give him the money.

868
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:55,817
Driving into an ambush was never
part of the deal. I'm calling this off.

869
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:59,404
Like hell you are. This is
a Customs case, Bilkins.

870
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:01,614
No one's calling
this off unless I do.

871
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:03,533
Look, this is real simple.

872
01:10:04,075 --> 01:10:06,160
You make the run, you get
Verone and his cash together,

873
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:08,371
so I can move in
for the bust.

874
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:11,749
You don't, I'll file enough charges
on both of you to make you disappear.

875
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,042
Take these.

876
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:16,629
We're gonna have GPS on you the
whole time so you don't get any cute ideas.

877
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,923
And to make sure nothing
happens to them, right?

878
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,466
Yeah, right.

879
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,102
That guy's a dick, man.

880
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:36,190
Let me get this right.

881
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:39,110
If we don't do this,
then we go to jail.

882
01:10:39,444 --> 01:10:42,405
But if we do it, then
Verone's going to kill us.

883
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:45,700
- It's a hell of a deal, huh?
- Yeah.

884
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,703
Maybe it is.

885
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:54,584
I know this guy's got an ass full of
loot that he's ready to dump in our cars.

886
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:59,130
And I can think of two reasons why
Verone doesn't need that money anymore.

887
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:00,548
Here we go.

888
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:02,133
You and me.

889
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,968
Just like the old days.

890
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,386
What do you think?

891
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:08,347
I think they messed with the
wrong two guys, that's what I think.

892
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:13,603
- Yo, Tej, what's up, bro?
- TEJ: <i>What up?</i>

893
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:15,396
Hey, man, how quickly
can you organize?

894
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,274
TEJ: Look, if y'all really
want to carry out this plan,

895
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:21,819
this is definitely the best place to
do it. So what do y'all think, man?

896
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:24,489
I think it's perfect.
So, what do they store here?

897
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:31,829
Man, this thing is clean.

898
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:33,122
Distributor cap.

899
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:52,391
Jimmy, do we have any half-empty
bottles of nitrous lying around?

900
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:54,811
Sure, but I've already
loaded you for spray.

901
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:57,438
No, I'm thinking we may
need it for something else

902
01:11:57,522 --> 01:12:00,274
'cause our cars may get a
little crowded, you know?

903
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:11,410
Man, when did you
start eating so much?

904
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,205
I was in jail, bruh.

905
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:17,375
I know how shitty the
grub is on the inside.

906
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:21,087
With the way things are
shaping up out here right now,

907
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:24,382
it'll be a matter of time before
I'm back in there, or dead.

908
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:28,928
So I'm trying to eat
all I can while I can.

909
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:33,641
Plus, the doctor tells me
I got a high metabolism.

910
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,439
Man, you remember us
growing up?

911
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:43,442
You know,
playing football in the dirt?

912
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:47,738
You know, getting into trouble.
All the stupid things we did?

913
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:51,951
When you got busted, you know,
whether I was a cop or not,

914
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:54,287
you know, if there was
anything I could have done,

915
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:57,039
you know,
I would have done it.

916
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,792
I just want you to know that.

917
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:02,962
Is that why you
let that dude go in L.A.?

918
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:07,800
Yeah, I think that had
a lot to do with it.

919
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,971
When I got busted

920
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:14,432
it wasn't your fault.

921
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:18,227
It was all on me,
Mr. Roman Pearce.

922
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,813
Wild and out. Crazy man.

923
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,066
No one could tell me nothing.

924
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:25,610
Riding solo.

925
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,653
Yeah, well, not anymore.

926
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:34,994
Not anymore, bro.

927
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:02,688
I've got Verone's Navigator
leaving the residence.

928
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:03,898
Copy.

929
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:07,360
Sir, we've got Verone
on the move to the airstrip.

- It's all right, let him out.
- Get out.

1087
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:21,685
Pop the trunk.

1088
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:23,520
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1089
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:25,480
Hurry up.

1090
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:42,205
Where's the rest of it?

1091
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:44,249
- The other car.
- Another car?

1092
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:47,127
- Where's the other car?
- On its way.

1093
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:48,920
- On the way?
- Yeah.

1094
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:51,381
Here's your money.

1095
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:54,801
So you know nothing about
the agents that stormed my jet?

1096
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:05,103
The funny thing is, I only told
one person about the airstrip.

1097
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:23,455
Customs agents sure are
getting pretty, aren't they?

1098
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:29,252
Put her on the boat.

1099
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:33,631
- Let's go.
- Get on the boat.

1100
01:32:48,021 --> 01:32:50,148
Hide the cars
and get rid of him.

1101
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:51,733
Back in the car.

1102
01:33:19,636 --> 01:33:20,845
End of the road.

1103
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:24,682
You know, I like you.

1104
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:27,727
But I still got to kill you.
It's my job.

1105
01:33:31,314 --> 01:33:32,690
What's that?

1106
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:34,067
What's that?

1107
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:35,735
PEARCE: <i>It's Barstow, baby!</i>

1108
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:37,529
It's about to get ugly!

1109
01:33:45,829 --> 01:33:47,288
Let's go. Let's go.

1110
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:24,284
Come on.

1111
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:52,020
You had me.

1112
01:34:54,314 --> 01:34:55,773
You slipped.

1113
01:34:57,108 --> 01:34:59,861
Eleven and a half months,
and you slipped once.

1114
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:03,031
Put her downstairs.

1115
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:10,872
See you in a second.

1116
01:35:16,586 --> 01:35:18,004
I thought you was dead, man.

1117
01:35:18,087 --> 01:35:20,256
Yeah, me, too.
Thanks for saving my ass, bro.

1118
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:21,633
What are you doing, Brian?

1119
01:35:21,674 --> 01:35:25,011
I don't know, but if Verone sees a
helicopter or Customs boat, she's dead!

1120
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:26,137
PEARCE: Boat.

1121
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:28,139
Car. Boat.

1122
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:30,975
You're not gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

1123
01:35:31,017 --> 01:35:34,062
- Yeah, I think so. You got my back, bro?
- Yeah.

1124
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:35,480
All right,
put on the seat belt.

1125
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:37,398
Show him some
Dukes of Hazzard shit!

1126
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:40,193
We're gonna do this big!
Hold on, Rome! Hold on!

1127
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:48,368
Brian, you're crazy, man!

1128
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:50,203
What the hell are you doing?

1129
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:17,689
I think I broke my arm, man.

1130
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:32,245
Get the gun.

1131
01:36:53,182 --> 01:36:54,767
It's over, Carter.

1132
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:03,067
You okay?

1133
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:04,402
Yeah!

1134
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:06,654
I'm great.

1135
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:14,829
We got him, man.

1136
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:18,333
We got him.
Let's get out of here.

1137
01:37:38,144 --> 01:37:39,854
POLICEMAN: Go. Go.

1138
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:50,698
WOMAN: That ought to do it.

1139
01:37:51,282 --> 01:37:54,827
So, there were three bags
total? The three from the boat?

1140
01:37:55,828 --> 01:37:57,663
So we're good, right?

1141
01:37:58,039 --> 01:37:59,374
Our records are clean?

1142
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:01,209
You held up your end.

1143
01:38:01,793 --> 01:38:03,461
Your records are clean.

1144
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:23,940
So maybe there were six bags.

1145
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:26,901
I guess we can call it even.

1146
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:28,986
- Agent Dunn?
- Sir.

1147
01:38:32,782 --> 01:38:34,700
We found some more evidence.

1148
01:38:36,619 --> 01:38:38,287
Come on,
let's take it to the truck.

1149
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:45,044
Don't drop the soap,
big homey.

1150
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:50,800
I hope you know that when he
gets out, he's going to kill your ass.

1151
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:53,845
He ain't getting out.

1152
01:38:55,596 --> 01:38:57,014
I'll see you soon.

1153
01:38:57,557 --> 01:39:00,560
- You think he's going to get out?
- He'll be out.

1154
01:39:01,853 --> 01:39:04,188
Not for real. You think
he's getting out, dawg?

1155
01:39:04,856 --> 01:39:07,358
We took care of your decoys.
They're free and clear.

1156
01:39:07,483 --> 01:39:09,569
There's a sedan
out on the road for you.

1157
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:11,821
Try to bring it
back in one piece.

1158
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:16,534
Thanks a lot, Bilkins.
You're all right.

1159
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:18,911
- Thanks.
- Thanks for looking out, man.

1160
01:39:21,622 --> 01:39:23,624
Do you trust me now?

1161
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:25,209
You're all right.

1162
01:39:29,672 --> 01:39:30,840
Sorry.

1163
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:34,135
Nice working with you,
O'Conner.

1164
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:35,595
Same here.

1165
01:39:47,857 --> 01:39:51,944
I might have to stay here in Miami,
and keep you out of trouble, bruh.

1166
01:39:54,739 --> 01:39:56,574
You know
what I'm talking about.

1167
01:39:56,657 --> 01:39:58,743
You're going to kick it
in Miami, bro?

1168
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:02,288
Oh, man, I love Miami.
Miami is off the hook!

1169
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:06,459
Open a garage together.

1170
01:40:07,251 --> 01:40:10,254
A garage? How are we
going to do that, bruh?

1171
01:40:14,884 --> 01:40:16,928
Pockets ain't empty, cuz.

1172
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:23,392
And we ain't hungry
no more either, right?
