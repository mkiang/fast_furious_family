327
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:15,793
to go looking
for you, brother.

328
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:23,342
Where were you?

329
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:24,760
There were
mass cops there.

330
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:26,178
They came in
from every direction.

331
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:27,638
That shit was orchestrated.

332
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:28,847
This your beer?

333
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:30,057
Yeah, that's my beer.

334
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:35,687
Yo, Einstein.
Take it upstairs.

335
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:38,690
You can't detail a car
with the cover on.

336
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:41,443
Can't even get that right.

337
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:42,820
You all right?

338
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:46,323
Am I all right?

339
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:47,950
It was just
a question.

340
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:54,540
Yo, Dom! Why'd you
bring the buster here?

341
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:57,000
'Cause the buster
kept me out of handcuffs!

342
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:59,294
He didn't just run
back to the fort!

343
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:01,380
The buster brought me back.

344
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:11,306
You can have any brew you want
as long as it's a Corona.

345
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,349
BRIAN: Thanks, man.

346
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:13,767
That's Vince's,
so enjoy it.

347
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:17,146
You...

348
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:26,321
Hey, bro,
you got a bathroom?

349
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:28,490
Yeah, upstairs.
First door on the right.

350
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:46,508
He's got no call
being up in here.

351
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,093
You don't know
that fool for shit!

352
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:49,678
Yeah, he's right, Dom.

353
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:51,972
Vince, there was a time
when I didn't know you.

354
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:53,765
That was
in the third grade!

355
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:55,184
ALL: Yeah.

356
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,729
DOM: Yeah, so,
what girls are here?

357
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:00,522
You just name it.
You want mine?

358
00:33:00,606 --> 00:33:03,066
You need to shut the F...
You want two?

359
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:04,443
You don't have anything?

360
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:05,944
You look a bit tired.

361
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:08,530
I think you should go upstairs
and give me a massage.

362
00:33:08,614 --> 00:33:09,781
Look at all our guests.

363
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:12,743
How about we go upstairs
and you give me a massage?

364
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:16,788
LEON: Crazy bitch.

365
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:22,669
Yo.

366
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:27,132
You know you owe me
a 10-second car, right?

367
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:30,302
Ouch.

368
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:33,222
Oh, shit.

369
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:40,479
Did you wipe the seat?

370
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:47,569
Jesus Christ! Would you cut
this shit already? Come on!

371
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:51,615
Come on, let's go
get me a drink.

372
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:54,493
Come on, man. We were
just about to get along.

373
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:55,702
LEON: Yeah.

374
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:02,584
So, what do you want?

375
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:04,044
MIA: Anything,
long as it's cold.

376
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:08,131
You know,
my brother likes you.

377
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:09,967
He usually
doesn't like anybody.

378
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:11,510
Yeah, he's
a complicated guy.

379
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:13,637
Yeah? What about you?

380
00:34:16,265 --> 00:34:17,516
I'm simpler.

381
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:18,934
You're a shitty liar.

382
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,813
Well, I'll take
that as a compliment.

383
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,816
There's a problem.

384
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:27,025
What's that?

385
00:34:27,526 --> 00:34:29,528
You need
to get some sleep.

386
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,865
And you definitely,
definitely need a shower.

387
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:37,119
Come on,
I'll take you home.

00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:18,994
COP: Shut up.

399
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:20,746
He's clean, Sarge.

400
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:33,258
BRIAN: Damn! Muse, will you
take these things off?

401
00:35:33,342 --> 00:35:35,218
I mean, shit,
you put them on so tight.

402
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:36,803
I like realism.

You never know
who's watching, Brian.

404
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:45,354
Wow. Nice crib, Sergeant.

405
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:47,606
It's a lot nicer than that
last place you confiscated.

406
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:49,858
Ain't it? You know,

00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:01,995
Fresh from Toretto's
hot rod heaven.

412
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,247
That was an $80,000
vehicle, officer.

413
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:05,832
Wait a minute.
You tell him what happened?

414
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,376
He knows what happened.
Hey, you know what?

415

Why don't you send the bill

The kid's giving me attitude?

417
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:13,632
That doesn't speak very well for
police-FBI relations, Tanner.

418
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:14,800
I mean, come on,
what is this?

419
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:16,218
I walk in the door
and the guy's giving me...

All right, all right,
all right. We'll talk, okay?

Come on.

424
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:25,477
Regular or decaf, Sarge?

425
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:28,438
Decaf, I think.

So we know that it's somebody
in the street racing world.

this case soon

V\Ie all know this world
revolves around Toretto, right?

00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:22,826
Now, I'm not saying
that he's necessarily

448
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,119
the one that's
popping these trucks,

but I can guarantee the both
of you that he knows who is.

Is Harry cooperating?

455
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:41,720

property if he doesn't.

457
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,474
What kind of vibe
is he getting from Toretto?

458
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:46,600
BRIAN: He's scared
to death of him,

459
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:49,186
but he doesn't think he's jacking
trucks in his spare time, either.

460
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:50,312
He's too controlled for that.

461
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:51,480
Wait.

462
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:54,566
Not that I want to contradict
Harry's fine judge of character,

463
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:58,320
but Toretto did hard time for
nearly beating a guy to death.

464
00:37:58,403 --> 00:38:01,490
He's got nitrous oxide in his
blood and a gas tank for a brain.

00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:13,084
Hold off on that.

what to do with this.

472
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:25,680
This is your car.

00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:26,932
MY Car?

474
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:30,560
I said, a 10-second car,
not a 10-minute car.

475
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:34,606
You could push this across
the finish line, or tow it.

476
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:38,276
Couldn't even tow that
across the finish line.

477
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:40,737
No faith.

478
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:44,449
I have faith in you, but this isn't
a junkyard, this is a garage.

479
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:45,534
Hey, pop the hood.

480
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:46,660
Pop the hood?

481
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:48,161
Pop the hood.

482
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:52,666

No shit.

483
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:53,792
Man, what did
I tell you?

I retract my
previous statement.

You know what?

486
00:38:56,795 --> 00:39:01,383
This will decimate all after
you put about $15,000 in it

overnight parts from Japan.

I gotta get you racing again so I
can make some money off your ass.

491

There's this showdown in the
desert called Race Wars

492
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:17,941
and that's
where you'll do it.

493

you're not working at Harry's,

in this garage, Mr. Arizona,

near a car.

500
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:05,655
They'll save us
about two pounds.

501
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:10,118
And they're gonna give us better
traction for the hole shot. All right?

502
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:13,413
Okay, so this is your
basic layout of the car,

503
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:17,542

look like when it's finished.

Yes, that shit. Yeah.

511

something about engines

515

that he had died
before the tanks blew.

intend to keep hitting him,

with my brother.

785

Actually, he didn't ever actually
grow up, as you can tell,

786
00:59:10,716 --> 00:59:12,760
but they were
friends as kids.

787
00:59:12,843 --> 00:59:15,137
And Letty, she just...
She lived down the street.

788
00:59:15,554 --> 00:59:17,014
Always into cars, though.

789
00:59:17,181 --> 00:59:18,599
Ever since she was
like 10 years old.

790
00:59:18,682 --> 00:59:22,394
So, naturally, you know, my
brother always had her attention.

791
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:24,772
And then she turned 16...

792
00:59:24,897 --> 00:59:26,690
And then she had
Dom's attention.

793
00:59:26,899 --> 00:59:30,027
Yeah. Yeah, it's funny
how that works, isn't it?

00:59:38,702 --> 00:59:41,622
Well, Jesse and Leon just
sort of showed up one night

798
00:59:41,705 --> 00:59:43,332
and never ever left.

799
00:59:43,415 --> 00:59:45,793
Well, it's just the way my
brother is, though, you know?

800
00:59:45,876 --> 00:59:47,377
Dom's like...

801
00:59:48,504 --> 00:59:50,464
