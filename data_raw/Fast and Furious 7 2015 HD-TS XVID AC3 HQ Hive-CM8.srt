00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:24,587
LONDON, ENGLAND

2
00:00:24,743 --> 00:00:26,800
They say if you want a
glimpse of the future...

3
00:00:27,716 --> 00:00:29,454
Just look behind you.

4
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:33,062
I used to think
that was bollocks.

5
00:00:35,123 --> 00:00:36,349
Now I realize...

6
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,567
you can't outrun the past.

7
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:48,061
When we were kids...

8
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,745
You'd start fights with the
toughest bastards in the yard.

9
00:00:53,604 --> 00:00:54,960
But I was the one...

10
00:00:55,073 --> 00:00:57,334
who were to step in and finish them.

11
00:00:58,105 --> 00:00:59,623
Rest now, little brother.

12
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:02,318
While I settle your one last score.

13
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:10,474
Take care of my brother.

14
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:13,368
Anything happens to him...

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,295
I'll come back looking for you.

16
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:39,317
Here.

17
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:40,318
Hold this.

18
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:39,111
<i><b>FAST & FURIOUS 7</b></i>

19
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:48,492
Come on, Dom, so where
are you taking me?

20
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:51,458
They say an open road helps you think...

21
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:54,062
about where you've been...

22
00:02:54,828 --> 00:02:56,058
where you're going.

23
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,750
So you don't remember any of this yet?

24
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:02,438
It's not fair.

25
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:04,602
You know I don't.

26
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:12,207
So what is it exactly that
you're trying to show me?

27
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:14,524
That.

28
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:20,523
Race Wars.

29
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:23,765
We used to come here?

30
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:25,297
"Come here"?

31
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:26,962
We invented it.

32
00:03:30,781 --> 00:03:31,781
RACE WARS

33
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:11,248
Keep it under 9000 rpms.

34
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:14,629
Kid's gonna fire his
pistons after the first 200.

35
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:18,263
You know that's not my style,
I got to ride or die, right?

36
00:04:20,523 --> 00:04:22,249
How about you just ride on this one.

37
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:41,999
Are you ready?

38
00:04:44,844 --> 00:04:45,873
I know you're ready!

39
00:04:59,992 --> 00:05:01,175
Go!

40
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,113
(crowd cheering)

41
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:47,185
Nice job!

42
00:05:50,781 --> 00:05:51,781
Hey!

43
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,539
That's the girl I heard so much about.

44
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,882
Where you been at, ghost girl?

45
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:01,864
That's the girl...

46
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:04,713
Ghost girl...

47
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:15,054
Letty, what the hell?

48
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:24,578
Damn, Dom! Your girl's
still got that swing, homie.

49
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,188
You never could take a punch.

50
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:31,159
Right, right.

51
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:34,108
Hey, man, I'm glad you're back,
man. It's good to see you.

52
00:06:34,654 --> 00:06:36,204
Good to see you, Héctor.

53
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:57,961
Alright. We made it, Jack.

54
00:06:58,074 --> 00:07:00,347
- Yeah, we made it!
- Yeah, we made it.

55
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,261
I just gotta, find
that door button.

56
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:03,956
Buddy where's the door
button at? Do you know?

57
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,005
- Hey.
- Hey.

58
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:08,119
Yeah, of course.

59
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:09,865
I'm new to this.

60
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,659
Yeah, you don't seem
like the minivan type.

61
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:12,431
No, not exactly.

62
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:14,453
Hey buddy you didn't give me
a high-five? Wait, wait, wait.

63
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:16,259
High-five! All right! Yeah, buddy.

64
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:17,848
Appreciate it, thank you.

65
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:19,668
Don't worry, you'll get used
to this in no time.

66
00:07:22,171 --> 00:07:23,333
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

67
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:57,494
First time I saw this...

68
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:00,918
I thought it was kind of funny.

69
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,479
I guess now, the joke's on me.

70
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,367
What are you doing?

71
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,004
What I should've
done a long time ago.

72
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:16,634
Stop!

73
00:08:18,121 --> 00:08:19,343
Look at it.

74
00:08:20,142 --> 00:08:21,538
It's the truth.

75
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:23,349
-------

76
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,966
That's the date that I lost my memory.

77
00:08:26,804 --> 00:08:28,892
That's the date that Letty died.

78
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:31,983
And I was born.

79
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:32,593
No.

80
00:08:32,704 --> 00:08:34,346
You never died.

81
00:08:34,465 --> 00:08:36,996
Do you know how hard it is
for me when you look at me?

82
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:39,769
And you see me through
15 years of memories?

83
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:43,347
Every beautiful moment we've ever had.

84
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,699
I see it in your eyes.

85
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:48,400
I can't give that to you.

86
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:50,579
I got nothing.

87
00:08:50,723 --> 00:08:52,000
You got me.

88
00:08:53,857 --> 00:08:56,092
And you've got only a piece of me.

89
00:08:56,924 --> 00:08:59,242
I have to find myself.

90
00:08:59,353 --> 00:09:00,483
For me.

91
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:17,500
Goodbye, Dom.

92
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:32,317
DIPLOMATIC SECURITY SERVICE
LOS ANGELES DIVISION

93
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,118
--------

94
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:40,511
You're disappointed, aren't you?

95
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,354
What are you talking about?

96
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:44,487
The last arrest.

97
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,729
It was too easy.
Target didn't even run.

98
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:48,842
Ah, it's okay.

99
00:09:49,384 --> 00:09:51,140
Gives me a chance to hit the iron.

100
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:54,736
Also, lets me work on
my stamping skills.

101
00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:57,854
You're a terrible liar.

102
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:00,605
See you tomorrow, boss.

103
00:10:00,718 --> 00:10:02,622
- I'll see you then.
- Don't stay too late.

104
00:10:02,696 --> 00:10:04,216
I'll stay as long as I want, woman.

105
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,941
I knew you'd say that.

106
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,618
Elena?

107
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,436
What's this?

108
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:30,786
It's the letter of
recommendation you asked for.

109
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:33,490
Just know I meant
every word in there.

110
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:37,575
Thanks, Hobbs.

111
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,302
Thanks for everything.

112
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,978
Come on, way too sentimental right now.

113
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,785
Get home.
Good night.

114
00:10:46,904 --> 00:10:48,157
Okay. Bye.

115
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,399
Just one sec.

116
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,498
You sure as hell ain't the IT guy
so you better start talking...

117
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,928
before I break that
finger six different ways...

118
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:37,053
and stick it straight right
where the sun doesn't shine.

119
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,154
Agent Hobbs, right?

120
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:43,126
That's right.

121
00:11:43,897 --> 00:11:47,454
I'm also the last man on Earth whose
computer you wanna be hacking into.

122
00:11:48,263 --> 00:11:51,180
You just earned yourself a
dance with the devil, boy.

123
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,631
You're under arrest.

124
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:57,525
Like I said, I'm here for the
team that crippled my brother.

125
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,603
There ain't no goddamn team.

126
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:04,324
It was just one man, and he's
standing right in front of you.

127
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:13,931
The lady was right.

128
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,729
You are a terrible liar.

129
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,377
Goddamn IT guys.

130
00:13:33,826 --> 00:13:34,826
Hobbs!

131
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:37,064
On me!

132
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:48,174
Elena!

133
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:10,552
Hobbs?

134
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:13,719
Hobbs!

135
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,290
-----------

136
00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:44,714
Alright buddy, we gotta
go or we'll be late.

137
00:14:44,828 --> 00:14:45,828
Come on.

138
00:14:46,646 --> 00:14:47,981
Okay, uhh.

139
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:50,241
What do you think?

140
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,420
Parking brake slide
right up to the school?

141
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:53,633
Where's mommy?

142
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,642
I don't know.
She's up there. She's coming.

143
00:14:55,713 --> 00:14:57,955
Oh.

144
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:03,693
Watch your head.

145
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,968
Dom, you have a package out here.

146
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,537
From Tokyo.

147
00:15:08,652 --> 00:15:09,845
Tokyo?

148
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:13,230
What's Han trying, to convert
me over to a turbo charger?

149
00:15:13,342 --> 00:15:14,635
You ready?

150
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:16,314
There we go.

151
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:18,991
Hey buddy, cars don't fly.

152
00:15:19,091 --> 00:15:21,300
Hey, cars don't fly.

153
00:15:21,335 --> 00:15:22,268
This one did, huh?

154
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:24,389
Brian in a minivan.

155
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:26,273
Things have changed.

156
00:15:26,314 --> 00:15:27,894
He's struggling, Dom.

157
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,530
He doesn't want me to see it...

158
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:34,005
but the white picket fence is
like an anchor for him. I can tell.

159
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:38,131
I tried to talk to him the other
night. Do you know what he said?

160
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,097
He doesn't miss the girls.
He doesn't miss the cars.

161
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,803
He misses the bullets.

162
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:46,895
Let him settle in.
Give him time.

163
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,961
How does nine months sound?

164
00:15:52,245 --> 00:15:54,245
I'm having another baby.

165
00:15:59,444 --> 00:16:01,206
And you didn't tell him, did you?

166
00:16:04,636 --> 00:16:06,252
You gotta tell him.

167
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,185
I don't want him to be
disappointed with this life.

168
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,725
With me.

169
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:17,791
He will never be disappointed with you.

170
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,467
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to him.

171
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:25,162
Thank you.

172
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:35,812
Yeah?

173
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:37,448
Dominic Toretto.

174
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:40,337
You don't know me.

175
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,569
<i>You're about to.</i>

176
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:43,179
<i>Private number
Tokyo, Japan</i>

177
00:16:45,014 --> 00:16:46,233
Get down!

178
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,594
Jack!

179
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:12,995
Jack!

180
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:47,943
Shattered his collarbone,
fractured his leg in two places.

181
00:17:48,303 --> 00:17:50,328
He only regained
consciousness this morning.

182
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:53,470
First thing he said was,
"Get me Dom".

183
00:17:56,938 --> 00:17:58,125
He's in there.

184
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:09,768
You okay?

185
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:12,861
I'm fine.

186
00:18:14,128 --> 00:18:15,665
He's waiting. Let's go.

187
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:27,714
Got something for you.

188
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:32,304
Your files.

189
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,455
Thank you.

190
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:38,296
You risk life and limb
to save the free world...

191
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:38,762
and what do they give you?

192
00:18:38,874 --> 00:18:41,815
Jell-O and a bad 70's TV show.

193
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:47,255
Y'know, it's got its perks.

194
00:18:47,368 --> 00:18:48,528
Sponge baths ain't that bad.

195
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,637
Dad!

196
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:50,713
I'm sorry, baby.

197
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:51,982
"Dad"?

198
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,493
Honey, I want to
introduce you to somebody.

199
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:56,347
He's a, uhh...

200
00:18:57,211 --> 00:18:58,345
He's an old friend.

201
00:18:58,445 --> 00:18:59,847
Go on and say hello.

202
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:01,147
Dominic Toretto, right?

203
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:04,940
My dad said, he kicked your ass once.

204
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:06,952
Who did this?

205
00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:10,102
You remember Owen Shaw?

206
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:14,239
The one we tore half of
London down trying to get.

207
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:15,335
Well...

208
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:17,403
This is his big, bad brother.

209
00:19:17,492 --> 00:19:18,528
Take a look at this.

210
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:25,084
-----------

211
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,669
"Deckard Shaw"

212
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,182
British Special Forces assassin.

213
00:19:29,297 --> 00:19:31,418
The kind of unique asset...

214
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,649
that no government would
ever admit to employing.

215
00:19:33,761 --> 00:19:34,912
Black Ops boys.

216
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,749
Worse. They created a monster.

217
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:42,048
They felt Shaw was a necessary
evil until eventually...

218
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:44,929
they decided he was unnecessary.

219
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:49,727
The powers that be, felt that he 
knew just a little bit too much.

220
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:51,563
The asset became a liability.

221
00:19:51,637 --> 00:19:54,450
So they sent in 20 elite
operatives to retire him.

222
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,280
And they missed.

223
00:19:56,304 --> 00:19:58,977
That was 6 years ago and Shaw's
been a ghost ever since.

224
00:19:59,172 --> 00:20:00,172
Until now.

225
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:04,270
How do I find him?

226
00:20:04,405 --> 00:20:07,182
The official answer is: you don't.

227
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:11,935
He killed Han.

228
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,890
Almost killed my family.

229
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,018
He also tried to put
me in a body bag, too.

230
00:20:16,094 --> 00:20:18,585
Which is why when I get out, I'm
gonna put a hurt on him so bad...

231
00:20:18,662 --> 00:20:21,366
he's gonna wish his mother
had kept her legs closed.

232
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:24,382
But until then, my official answer to you...

233
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:26,329
is stand down.

234
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:28,343
Now you know I can't do that.

235
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:29,683
I do know you, Dom.

236
00:20:29,786 --> 00:20:33,492
Which is why now I give you
a brother to brother answer.

237
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:36,131
You do whatever it is you gotta do.

238
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,050
When you find that sumbitch...

239
00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:40,852
Just do me one favor.

240
00:20:40,928 --> 00:20:42,041
What's that?

241
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:45,362
Don't miss.

242
00:20:48,018 --> 00:20:51,654
MONTECRISTO,
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

243
00:20:54,491 --> 00:20:56,384
Thank you so much for
letting us stay, Mando.

244
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:57,632
I hope it's not a problem.

245
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:00,562
Listen, Dom needed a safe
delivered to Rio in two days.

246
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:01,808
That was a problem.

247
00:21:02,032 --> 00:21:04,053
Hosting his family in
the Dominican Republic,

248
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:05,361
that is vacation.

249
00:21:05,476 --> 00:21:06,811
Anyone messes with you here...

250
00:21:06,927 --> 00:21:08,821
they're messing with
the entire country.

251
00:21:08,895 --> 00:21:09,976
You'll be safe.

252
00:21:14,661 --> 00:21:21,335
Yeah, they're here. I picked
them up myself at the airport.

253
00:21:21,453 --> 00:21:23,514
Hold on. Your brother.

254
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,150
Dom.

255
00:21:25,174 --> 00:21:26,477
Yeah, Mia, it's me.

256
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:27,595
How's it going there?

257
00:21:27,652 --> 00:21:30,321
We're at Mando's. This
place is like a fortress.

258
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:33,841
You should see Brian.
He's in full FBI mode.

259
00:21:33,952 --> 00:21:37,124
He built a surveillance hub in
Mando's garage and everything.

260
00:21:37,237 --> 00:21:39,682
<i>What about you? Did you find
out who's after us?</i>

261
00:21:39,797 --> 00:21:42,667
Looks like the sins of
London have followed us home.

262
00:21:42,778 --> 00:21:44,541
<i>How did Buster take the news?</i>

263
00:21:44,652 --> 00:21:45,652
I can't tell him.

264
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:48,196
<i>If he knew about the baby,
he'd stay here with us.</i>

265
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:51,043
<i>And with all that's going on, you're
gonna need him by your side.</i>

266
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:54,068
Just watch out for
him. Keep him safe.

267
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,086
And come home together.

268
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,823
Tell Brian I'll see
him in LA in two days.

269
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:00,566
Where are you going?

270
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,590
Tokyo.

271
00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:04,168
I'm bringing Han home.

272
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:08,143
<i>Authorities are still
trying to determine...</i>

273
00:22:08,144 --> 00:22:10,862
<i>the motive behind this daring
attack here at the office...</i>

274
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:15,285
<i>of the US Diplomatic Security Service
in downtown Los Ángeles...</i>

275
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:16,436
<i>less than 36 hours ago.</i>

276
00:22:17,243 --> 00:22:18,825
Facts are still coming in...

277
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:21,934
but what is known is the suspect
entered the building's 4th floor...

278
00:22:23,293 --> 00:22:24,293
Hey.

279
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,370
- You okay?
- Yeah.

280
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:30,380
This guy's just, relentless.

281
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:33,798
That's why Dom needs you.

282
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,361
You two need to find this
guy and you need to stop him...

283
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:39,769
before he does any more
damage to our family.

284
00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:43,174
I just...

285
00:22:45,271 --> 00:22:46,923
I've screwed up so many things.

286
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:50,853
I couldn't live with myself
if I screwed this up, too.

287
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:52,880
You won't.

288
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:55,115
I believe in you.

289
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,780
I believe in us.
That's all that matters.

290
00:23:00,474 --> 00:23:01,655
I love you, Brian.

291
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,513
Love you, baby.

292
00:23:14,515 --> 00:23:18,304
Just promise me.
After this, we're done.

293
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:20,762
No more jobs, no more enemies.

294
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:22,897
Come back to us.

295
00:23:23,012 --> 00:23:24,884
I won't let you down, Mia.

296
00:23:26,752 --> 00:23:27,762
I know.

297
00:23:30,078 --> 00:23:32,773
TOKYO, JAPAN

298
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,790
Hey yo, Sean!

299
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:46,469
Hey, check this out, man.

300
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:49,026
This dude over here
wanna race the new DK.

301
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:50,272
Not tonight, Twinkie.

302
00:23:52,404 --> 00:23:53,803
He said he knew Han.

303
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,245
Han said you was fast,
but not that damn fast.

304
00:24:05,155 --> 00:24:07,521
Who said American muscle can't drift?

305
00:24:08,783 --> 00:24:11,812
Han mentioned he left his
enemies in his rear view.

306
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:14,960
He never talked about it much.

307
00:24:16,575 --> 00:24:18,666
Always playing it
close to the vest.

308
00:24:24,035 --> 00:24:26,305
We found a couple of
things by the crash.

309
00:24:28,219 --> 00:24:29,299
Wasn't much left.

310
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:37,788
Gisele.

311
00:24:42,061 --> 00:24:43,061
Yeah.

312
00:24:43,885 --> 00:24:45,325
There's one more thing.

313
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:49,614
I found this.

314
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,182
Must've meant something to him.

315
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,211
When you find the
guy that killed Han...

316
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,065
What are you going to do?

317
00:25:02,706 --> 00:25:05,731
Words ain't even been invented yet.

318
00:25:27,247 --> 00:25:30,552
They say to live in the hearts
of those we leave behind...

319
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:32,933
is not to die.

320
00:25:34,025 --> 00:25:35,790
But he put you in his grave.

321
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,689
So now I'll do the same to him.

322
00:25:45,137 --> 00:25:47,133
I can't do no more funerals.

323
00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:49,922
First, Han...

324
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:55,221
Now Hobbs is laid
out, of all people.

325
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:01,964
We're being hunted.

326
00:26:08,627 --> 00:26:10,773
You know he's out there
somewhere watching, right?

327
00:26:12,018 --> 00:26:13,072
I hope so.

328
00:26:13,215 --> 00:26:14,610
That means he's close.

329
00:26:15,555 --> 00:26:17,754
Just promise me, Brian.

330
00:26:18,738 --> 00:26:20,363
No more funerals.

331
00:26:21,152 --> 00:26:22,152
Just one more.

332
00:26:26,197 --> 00:26:27,197
His.

333
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:31,716
------

334
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,797
You never should've 
messed with a man's family.

335
00:28:57,909 --> 00:28:59,891
I told your brother the same thing.

336
00:29:03,264 --> 00:29:04,858
Reinforced your chassis.

337
00:29:05,796 --> 00:29:07,873
Just like going into the
ring with weighted gloves.

338
00:29:07,874 --> 00:29:10,394
Your mistake. I'm not
here to play games.

339
00:29:11,192 --> 00:29:12,486
See, you and me...

340
00:29:13,323 --> 00:29:14,912
We're from different worlds.

341
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,919
Trust me, I've seen a lot meaner
streets than the ones you're used to.

342
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:20,493
Stick around.

343
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,494
It's gonna get a lot meaner.

344
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:28,363
You think this was
gonna be a street fight?

345
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:48,783
On the ground!

346
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:50,549
Now!

347
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,608
Drop him or I will drop you!

348
00:29:54,718 --> 00:29:55,718
Woah, woah!

349
00:29:55,973 --> 00:29:58,832
Easy, guys. We're on
the same team here.

350
00:29:59,701 --> 00:30:01,078
Mr. Toretto...

351
00:30:01,182 --> 00:30:02,728
I'm here on the recommendation...

352
00:30:02,837 --> 00:30:04,345
of a, mutual friend of ours.

353
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:06,176
- Mr. Hobbs?
- Who the hell are you?

354
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:07,761
Me? I'm just a guy.

355
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,241
I'm, Mr. Nobody.

356
00:30:10,312 --> 00:30:12,446
That's a big entrance for a nobody.

357
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:15,305
And the guy who put our
mutual friend in the hospital...

358
00:30:16,501 --> 00:30:17,990
you just let him get away.

359
00:30:18,064 --> 00:30:21,448
I think I might've just
saved your ass there, Dom.

360
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:24,744
Listen, you think you can
let go of my guy there?

361
00:30:24,853 --> 00:30:26,403
He's beginning to turn a little blue.

362
00:30:28,816 --> 00:30:29,816
I appreciate that.

363
00:30:30,606 --> 00:30:32,043
Here they come.

364
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:33,872
Listen, Dom.

365
00:30:33,962 --> 00:30:38,383
There's a war going on between
shadows and ghosts like me.

366
00:30:40,295 --> 00:30:43,353
You and your team unwittingly walked
into the middle of it in London...

367
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,586
and it appears it's
now followed you home.

368
00:30:48,084 --> 00:30:49,343
It's up to you.

369
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,762
I'm gonna have a beer.

370
00:30:52,553 --> 00:30:53,553
You're welcome to join me.

371
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,192
By the way, I can get you Deckard Shaw.

372
00:31:03,046 --> 00:31:06,406
BASE OF OPERATIONS
EL SEGUNDO, CALIFORNIA

373
00:31:09,372 --> 00:31:10,372
Belgian ale.

374
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:15,651
Man, those monks got it right.

375
00:31:15,764 --> 00:31:19,760
I don't know about the whole celibacy
thing, but when it comes to beer...

376
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:22,305
Would you like one?

377
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:24,715
I'm more of a Corona man myself.

378
00:31:28,288 --> 00:31:31,452
Your files, not only detailed...

379
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:35,510
It's, extremely entertaining.

380
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,585
Look, Shaw's power is
that he's a shadow.

381
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:47,397
He's really good at getting
in and out of places...

382
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:49,850
without being seen and leaving
nothing but a body count in his wake.

383
00:31:50,002 --> 00:31:53,045
He's a legitimate English badass.

384
00:31:53,324 --> 00:31:57,134
But to be honest with you Dom, I don't
give two shits about Deckard Shaw.

385
00:31:57,474 --> 00:31:58,548
It's you I want.

386
00:31:58,655 --> 00:32:03,165
Because you and I can help
each other get what we both need.

387
00:32:04,036 --> 00:32:05,720
I'm listening.

388
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,700
Just recently, a
private military company...

389
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:10,866
led by a wanted terrorist
named Mose Jakande...

390
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,386
kidnapped a hacker known
only by the name "Ramsey".

391
00:32:14,008 --> 00:32:16,452
Lady Liberty's got her panties in
a bunch over this but rightfully so...

392
00:32:16,587 --> 00:32:19,809
because this Ramsey has
created something interesting.

393
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:21,140
- Bring it up.
- Yes, sir.

394
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:22,736
Say hello...

395
00:32:23,298 --> 00:32:25,095
To God's Eye.

396
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,970
Now this little bastard hacks into
anything that's on a digital network.

397
00:32:28,064 --> 00:32:31,661
That means every cellphone,
satellite, ATM machine, and computer,

398
00:32:31,774 --> 00:32:32,774
simultaneously.

399
00:32:33,014 --> 00:32:36,642
If it's got a microphone or a lens,
God's Eye can use it to find you.

400
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:39,231
So you invited me here to
show me a tracking device.

401
00:32:39,373 --> 00:32:40,971
On steroids. Lots of them.

402
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,559
Let me put it
to you this way.

403
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:45,621
It took us nearly a decade
to find Osama bin Laden.

404
00:32:45,735 --> 00:32:48,352
With this, we could locate
him anywhere on the planet

405
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:49,582
in a couple of hours.

406
00:32:49,692 --> 00:32:52,105
Now that's a serious
piece of machinery...

407
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,341
that could be catastrophic
in the wrong hands.

408
00:32:54,415 --> 00:32:56,608
But for some very
nauseating, political reasons...

409
00:32:56,717 --> 00:33:00,815
any rescue plans involving any
US government forces or entity...

410
00:33:00,816 --> 00:33:02,861
has been strictly ruled out.

411
00:33:03,978 --> 00:33:06,389
And that's why I need you.

412
00:33:06,537 --> 00:33:08,262
But why do I need you?

413
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:13,112
I mean I could go back outside,
enjoy the rest of the Coronas...

414
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,257
let Shaw come to me.

415
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,206
You could do that. How's that
working out for you so far?

416
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:20,656
You got one friend in the ground,
another one in the hospital...

417
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:23,005
and then of course there's that
little issue of the bomb...

418
00:33:23,157 --> 00:33:24,412
that destroyed your home.

419
00:33:25,702 --> 00:33:28,613
Shaw lives in a world that
doesn't play by your rules.

420
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:31,169
Like it or not...

421
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:32,985
you live in that world now, too.

422
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,060
You wanna know how to kill a shadow?

423
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:38,143
You just shine a little light on it.

424
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:40,606
If you get the God's Eye for me...

425
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:44,267
I've already got authorization for
you to use it until you get Shaw.

426
00:33:44,617 --> 00:33:46,733
You go from the hunted, to the hunter.

427
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:49,211
And there's no place on
Earth Shaw can hide from you.

428
00:33:49,323 --> 00:33:50,493
More importantly,

429
00:33:51,222 --> 00:33:53,721
you and your family...

430
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,547
don't go to any more funerals.

431
00:33:57,473 --> 00:34:00,574
You get Ramsey, you get the God's Eye...

432
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:01,789
You get Shaw.

433
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:05,521
Well that's the windup and the pitch.

434
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:11,332
Now that I've given you this incredibly
sensitive and highly classified information...

435
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,529
What do you think, Toretto?

436
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,064
I think you already
know what I'm gonna do.

437
00:34:16,143 --> 00:34:17,143
Good.

438
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,744
But, it'll be my way.

439
00:34:20,963 --> 00:34:22,059
And my crew.

440
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,932
I assumed you might say that.

441
00:34:24,184 --> 00:34:27,993
Which is why I've taken the
liberty of gathering your team.

442
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:41,763
This is crazy.

443
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:44,612
What the hell is going on in here?

444
00:34:47,397 --> 00:34:50,654
Our intelligence suggests that
Ramsey will be transported...

445
00:34:50,727 --> 00:34:53,155
by an armed motorcade through
the Caucasus mountain range.

446
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:55,418
If they clear this range
and reach their destination...

447
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:57,236
Ramsey's as good as gone.

448
00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:58,542
So let me get this straight.

449
00:34:58,652 --> 00:35:00,838
There's only one road
that leads in or out...?

450
00:35:00,946 --> 00:35:02,789
Sheer drops on every side...

451
00:35:02,897 --> 00:35:06,070
A motorcade from hell
protected by a small army...

452
00:35:06,183 --> 00:35:07,879
from one mile on either direction?

453
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:09,752
Yeah, that's about it.

454
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:12,284
- You done?
- No, I'm not done.

455
00:35:12,914 --> 00:35:16,451
So you all wanted me to break
into a police station, fine.

456
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:18,379
Then you asked me to stop a tank.

457
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,363
I wasn't happy about it, but I did it.

458
00:35:20,437 --> 00:35:22,285
Then you came up with
this brillant idea...

459
00:35:22,385 --> 00:35:25,640
to shoot down one of the
largest airplanes, ever.

460
00:35:25,788 --> 00:35:27,729
I shot that shit outta the sky...

461
00:35:29,668 --> 00:35:30,668
It's nothing.

462
00:35:30,967 --> 00:35:32,469
But this right here, my friend...

463
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:37,013
happens to be the stupidest idea
I've ever heard of in my life.

464
00:35:37,122 --> 00:35:39,734
I forgot that, you were the only
one to bring that plane down.

465
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:42,851
No, only thing I've ever seen
him take down was "No knees" Denise.

466
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:44,451
Remember? At prom?

467
00:35:44,928 --> 00:35:47,179
Really, Brian? You're gonna
do that right here?

468
00:35:47,286 --> 00:35:49,006
See, y'all try'na
get me off my point.

469
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:52,691
All I'm saying is, I'm
tired of everybody around me...

470
00:35:52,805 --> 00:35:54,170
making all the decisions.

471
00:35:54,968 --> 00:35:56,268
This time, I lead.

472
00:35:56,382 --> 00:35:59,900
Seriously. If I don't
start making decisions, I'm out.

473
00:35:59,985 --> 00:36:01,036
All right, Roman.

474
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:03,214
What do you got?

475
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:09,370
I mean, I wouldn't try to get into
the whole leadership thing, like, now.

476
00:36:09,446 --> 00:36:10,807
You know what I'm saying?
I'm just kind of...

477
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:12,037
Talking about like, at some point.

478
00:36:12,181 --> 00:36:13,599
Like, you know, when we...

479
00:36:14,181 --> 00:36:16,182
Whatever. I mean, I think...

480
00:36:18,825 --> 00:36:19,825
Let's hit it from here.

481
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:21,690
- I don't think that that's...
- No, don't think.

482
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:23,309
That's my job.

483
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:27,529
Okay.

484
00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:30,817
It is impossible to hit it there.

485
00:36:31,653 --> 00:36:34,387
That is literally the most
secure spot on the mountain.

486
00:36:34,538 --> 00:36:37,568
Why? Because you cannot
physically access it.

487
00:36:37,692 --> 00:36:39,557
Now see, that's what makes it so sweet.

488
00:36:39,702 --> 00:36:42,746
Because it's the place that they
least expect us to hit them from.

489
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:45,811
As much as I hate to admit it,
he's on to something there.

490
00:36:45,925 --> 00:36:46,925
What do you think, Dom?

491
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:48,748
Here?

492
00:36:48,772 --> 00:36:49,772
Yeah.

493
00:36:50,854 --> 00:36:52,688
I think we got a plan.

494
00:36:52,846 --> 00:36:55,366
Completely wrong thinking.

495
00:36:55,476 --> 00:36:56,599
And I like it.

496
00:36:57,004 --> 00:36:59,166
- You see?
- I'm good at this.

497
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,860
Good?

498
00:37:00,896 --> 00:37:02,129
Okay.

499
00:37:02,276 --> 00:37:04,784
How are you planning on
getting on that road?

500
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,425
Well, Tej?

501
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:11,490
I think I may actually
have a plan for that.

502
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,087
What? I delegated.

503
00:37:14,964 --> 00:37:16,436
That's what good leaders do.

504
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,510
Leader!

505
00:37:18,534 --> 00:37:21,070
You know, when I was
reading your files...

506
00:37:21,186 --> 00:37:23,563
I was impressed with what you've
accomplished with your team.

507
00:37:23,638 --> 00:37:26,357
But, meeting them
now I gotta say, Dom...

508
00:37:27,502 --> 00:37:28,880
you truly have a gift.

509
00:37:32,346 --> 00:37:35,996
Consider my workshop
your new playhouse.

510
00:37:36,106 --> 00:37:37,500
I think you'll find our cars...

511
00:37:37,618 --> 00:37:39,316
extremely appealing.

512
00:37:40,263 --> 00:37:41,454
And your team...

513
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:43,517
is now complete.

514
00:37:54,553 --> 00:37:55,845
I went to the house.

515
00:37:57,355 --> 00:37:58,849
I was looking for you everywhere.

516
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:02,215
You scared the shit outta me.

517
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:08,164
You will never be alone...

518
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:09,863
(inaudible voices)

519
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:12,644
Where did you find that?

520
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:17,792
Found it in Han's car.

521
00:38:17,901 --> 00:38:19,678
It was left as a message.

522
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:21,713
A message I plan on returning.

523
00:38:23,491 --> 00:38:24,594
Can you ride?

524
00:38:24,706 --> 00:38:26,254
Yeah, of course I can.

525
00:38:26,803 --> 00:38:28,569
Han was my family, too.

526
00:38:33,225 --> 00:38:34,225
Brian!

527
00:38:34,906 --> 00:38:36,891
We're gonna need long
travel suspension...

528
00:38:36,999 --> 00:38:39,108
limited slip differentials
in all of them.

529
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,208
How you doing.

530
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:41,792
Tej!

531
00:38:41,909 --> 00:38:44,887
I want the demon
lovechild between that...

532
00:38:46,211 --> 00:38:47,539
and that.

533
00:38:49,042 --> 00:38:50,201
That's a lot of armor.

534
00:38:50,314 --> 00:38:52,982
Just gonna add more
weight, slow you down.

535
00:38:55,385 --> 00:38:57,999
This time it ain't
just about being fast.

536
00:39:04,957 --> 00:39:06,870
Yeah, I'm good.

537
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:10,648
From the streets, you
know what I'm sayin'?

538
00:39:10,734 --> 00:39:12,406
It's nothing.

539
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,850
<i>Hey, Roman, you're
freaking out, ain't you?</i>

540
00:39:20,933 --> 00:39:23,054
- No.
- Yeah, you are.

541
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,127
I said, no.

542
00:39:24,287 --> 00:39:27,587
<i>Listen man, it takes a grown man
to embrace his feelings.</i>

543
00:39:27,709 --> 00:39:29,971
<i>If you need to cry,
just go ahead and cry.</i>

544
00:39:31,062 --> 00:39:33,963
<i>As your friend, you know I'm
concerned about your well-being.</i>

545
00:39:34,142 --> 00:39:35,550
<i>Which is why I took the precaution...</i>

546
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:38,011
of putting some adult diapers
in your glove compartment.

547
00:39:38,082 --> 00:39:39,321
<i>Can you just chill out, man?</i>

548
00:39:39,931 --> 00:39:44,075
I have seen some crazy shit, Dom,
but this really could make some waves.

549
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:47,006
So let's just try to keep it
as low key as possible, huh?

550
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,628
Don't I always?

551
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:51,729
<i>I tell you what: you knock it down
a couple of notches this time...</i>

552
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:55,076
<i>and I'll swap out my
Belgian for a keg of Corona.</i>

553
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:57,925
You'd be doing yourself a favor there.

554
00:39:58,903 --> 00:40:01,415
Can somebody just walk me through
what we're supposed to be doing here?

555
00:40:01,476 --> 00:40:03,319
Come on, Rom. This was
your plan, you gotta embrace it.

556
00:40:03,423 --> 00:40:04,685
No, this was not my plan.

557
00:40:08,903 --> 00:40:10,506
Yeah, here we go. Gametime.

558
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,571
<i>Roman, you need some fresh air?</i>

559
00:40:25,598 --> 00:40:27,515
'Cause you about to
get a whole lot of it.

560
00:40:31,165 --> 00:40:32,470
Okay, here we go!

561
00:40:50,565 --> 00:40:52,590
Just when you didn't think it
can get any better, huh?

562
00:40:59,382 --> 00:41:00,382
Oh, shit!

563
00:41:15,407 --> 00:41:16,407
Now we're moving.

564
00:41:23,545 --> 00:41:26,457
Everybody good?
Everybody make it out?

565
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,890
You should tell 'em,
that this is not for you!

566
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:34,965
This is not your mission!

567
00:41:35,071 --> 00:41:37,839
<i>Rom, what's up man!
Talk to me, come on!</i>

568
00:41:38,206 --> 00:41:40,101
<i>- I can't do it.
- The hell, you can't!</i>

569
00:41:40,219 --> 00:41:43,643
Come on man! You throw that thing in
reverse and get your ass out here now!

570
00:41:43,645 --> 00:41:46,114
<i>Look I can't do it, okay?
Listen to what I'm saying.</i>

571
00:41:46,115 --> 00:41:47,115
Now isn't the time!

572
00:41:47,144 --> 00:41:48,589
<i>I'mma stay up here with the pilot.</i>

573
00:41:48,704 --> 00:41:51,816
<i>We're gonna circle around and make sure
we're holding them down from up here!</i>

574
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:53,221
We're running out of time!

575
00:41:53,334 --> 00:41:55,493
The chute is guided by GPS!

576
00:41:55,604 --> 00:41:57,405
You don't have to do anything!

577
00:41:57,483 --> 00:41:59,181
- Tej!
- I'm already on it.

578
00:41:59,691 --> 00:42:01,063
<i>Listen, man. Listen</i>

579
00:42:01,209 --> 00:42:04,522
I'm sorry to let y'all down, okay?
I'mma go ahead and stay up here.

580
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,448
<i>No, brother.</i>

581
00:42:05,563 --> 00:42:07,829
- I'm sorry to let you down.
- What?

582
00:42:09,488 --> 00:42:10,488
Is that...?

583
00:42:13,439 --> 00:42:15,460
Tej! What are you doing?

584
00:42:18,782 --> 00:42:22,647
No!

585
00:42:22,802 --> 00:42:23,920
Tej!

586
00:42:26,446 --> 00:42:27,784
I hate you, Tej!

587
00:42:31,137 --> 00:42:32,137
Get ready!

588
00:42:32,147 --> 00:42:33,660
Ground's coming fast!

589
00:42:41,514 --> 00:42:42,755
C'mon, baby.

590
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:44,019
Come on.

591
00:43:31,889 --> 00:43:33,130
Touchdown, baby!

592
00:43:37,662 --> 00:43:39,031
Car check. Call it in.

593
00:43:39,107 --> 00:43:40,287
- Check.
- Check.

594
00:43:40,288 --> 00:43:41,347
I'm good, let's do this.

595
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,898
Hello? Please man!

596
00:43:46,014 --> 00:43:47,736
Get me outta here, somebody!

597
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:49,098
No! The trees!

598
00:43:49,805 --> 00:43:50,805
Shit.

599
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,689
Sit tight, Roman.
We'll come back for you.

600
00:43:52,771 --> 00:43:54,048
This is not the plan!

601
00:43:59,489 --> 00:44:02,861
CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS,
AZERBAIJAN

602
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:15,450
All right.

603
00:44:15,451 --> 00:44:16,903
You got one chance to
hit them here, Dom.

604
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:18,564
You miss, they'll make it
to their black site...

605
00:44:18,715 --> 00:44:21,177
they'll squeeze whatever
information they need out of Ramsey.

606
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:24,080
The device and your chance of ever
getting Shaw will be gone for good.

607
00:44:24,189 --> 00:44:25,211
That ain't gonna happen.
 
608
00:44:25,905 --> 00:44:26,905
I'll see you at the pickup.

609
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:33,575
Ramsey, will be in the bus.

610
00:44:33,623 --> 00:44:34,623
Then let's do this.

611
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,198
Captain we have company.
Four cars inbound.

612
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:48,276
What, no!

613
00:45:13,643 --> 00:45:15,018
- Tej, shoot it!
- I'm on the way!

614
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:21,160
All right, formation!

615
00:45:27,926 --> 00:45:29,115
Bulletproof, baby.

616
00:45:35,064 --> 00:45:36,064
Punch it!

617
00:46:00,807 --> 00:46:01,807
Strike!

618
00:46:12,243 --> 00:46:13,341
Guns, free.

619
00:46:14,168 --> 00:46:15,168
Yes, sir.

620
00:46:18,936 --> 00:46:19,936
No!

621
00:46:23,138 --> 00:46:24,138
Shit!

622
00:46:24,418 --> 00:46:25,418
Get out of the way!

623
00:46:38,618 --> 00:46:40,534
Those aren't guns,
those are goddamn cannons!

624
00:46:40,645 --> 00:46:41,835
Armor piercing rounds!

625
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,023
Hook 'em up.

626
00:47:13,942 --> 00:47:15,446
Brian, Tej, blow it!

627
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:25,425
Lock it up.

628
00:47:36,372 --> 00:47:37,939
Brian, you're up!

629
00:47:56,437 --> 00:47:57,945
Little closer, Tej!

630
00:48:33,094 --> 00:48:34,279
Ramsey?

631
00:48:34,386 --> 00:48:35,752
Stay away from me!
Stay back!

632
00:48:35,866 --> 00:48:37,090
Don't you touch me!

633
00:48:37,198 --> 00:48:38,942
My name's Brian, and I'm
gonna get you out of here...

634
00:48:38,943 --> 00:48:40,198
but I'm gonna need you
to settle down, all right?

635
00:48:40,273 --> 00:48:41,570
I'm gonna cut those
things off of you.

636
00:48:57,276 --> 00:48:58,276
Sir?

637
00:48:59,321 --> 00:49:01,304
Sir, we have an
unidentified vehicle approaching.

638
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:04,870
Come on! Closer!

639
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:06,303
You have to jump!

640
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:07,594
We're out of time. Come on.

641
00:49:07,672 --> 00:49:08,952
We gotta get out of here!

642
00:49:09,608 --> 00:49:10,608
Come on!

643
00:49:11,002 --> 00:49:12,002
Look at me!

644
00:49:12,026 --> 00:49:14,247
If you don't jump,
we're gonna die! Okay?

645
00:49:14,999 --> 00:49:16,361
You're jumping. Come on!

646
00:49:16,475 --> 00:49:17,475
One.

647
00:49:17,862 --> 00:49:18,862
Two!

648
00:49:27,532 --> 00:49:29,150
Well, well, well.

649
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,740
Take my hand!

650
00:49:52,196 --> 00:49:54,597
Welcome to the party, Mr. Shaw.

651
00:50:43,831 --> 00:50:45,592
Letty, stay with Brian.

652
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,300
Oh shit!

653
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,365
What are you doing?
This is crazy!

654
00:51:17,481 --> 00:51:18,741
Keeping you alive!

655
00:52:04,069 --> 00:52:05,069
There's a cliff.

656
00:52:05,429 --> 00:52:07,120
Cliff! cliff!

657
00:52:48,494 --> 00:52:49,494
No!

658
00:53:39,476 --> 00:53:40,476
Too slow!

659
00:54:23,286 --> 00:54:24,808
Yeah!

660
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:28,690
I'm back, bitches!

661
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:01,930
You good?

662
00:56:01,976 --> 00:56:03,181
Thank you.

663
00:56:20,452 --> 00:56:21,822
Roman! Get back to the others.

664
00:56:21,931 --> 00:56:22,448
What about you?

665
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:23,915
Don't worry about me.

666
00:57:21,893 --> 00:57:24,520
I have to say, I am impressed.

667
00:57:25,048 --> 00:57:27,906
I would very much
like to know the name...

668
00:57:28,018 --> 00:57:31,478
of the man who is
causing me so much trouble.

669
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:33,975
There is no way out of there.

670
00:57:34,809 --> 00:57:35,964
What is he doing?

671
00:57:36,042 --> 00:57:37,939
He's frozen like a
damn deer on headlights.

672
00:57:38,105 --> 00:57:39,742
Toretto ain't no deer.

673
00:57:39,894 --> 00:57:41,013
Come on, Dominic.

674
00:57:41,672 --> 00:57:44,943
Give us the girl,
and I'll let you live.

675
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,600
What are you going to do?

676
00:57:49,047 --> 00:57:51,347
You might wanna put on
your helmet for this one.

677
00:58:00,582 --> 00:58:02,053
Target the driver!

678
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:10,962
Dammit! What is he thinking?

679
00:58:12,418 --> 00:58:13,818
You're insane!

680
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:23,517
You're pointing the wrong way!

681
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:25,166
Am I now?

682
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,741
Fire on my mark.

683
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:35,859
Interesting.

684
00:58:36,091 --> 00:58:37,091
Three!

685
00:58:37,752 --> 00:58:38,752
Two!

686
00:58:39,247 --> 00:58:40,247
Hold on.

687
00:58:40,249 --> 00:58:41,249
One!

688
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:43,290
Fire!

689
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:40,138
Looks like our demon lovechild worked.

690
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:41,833
That's one way down a mountain.

691
00:59:43,126 --> 00:59:44,126
Where's Ramsey?

692
00:59:58,245 --> 01:00:00,008
Hello Kitty's awake.

693
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,409
She don't look
like a hacker to me.

694
01:00:05,529 --> 01:00:08,259
Oh yeah? And what
do hackers look like?

695
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:09,459
They don't suppose to look...

696
01:00:09,571 --> 01:00:10,571
like that.

697
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:15,095
I'm just saying, like, how they
normally wear them li'l weird glasses...

698
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:19,056
that's all crooked, with pimples all
over they face from drinking soda.

699
01:00:19,603 --> 01:00:22,498
I mean trust me,
with a body like that...

700
01:00:22,609 --> 01:00:24,415
I ain't gonna park
it behind a computer.

701
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:26,140
How you feeling?

702
01:00:26,518 --> 01:00:27,574
Did you hit your head?

703
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,265
Feeling nauseous?
Ears ringing?

704
01:00:31,758 --> 01:00:32,758
No?

705
01:00:32,782 --> 01:00:34,152
Where's my shoe?

706
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:36,390
It flew off when you crashed.

707
01:00:36,502 --> 01:00:39,196
When you start experiencing any
of those things, let me know. Okay?

708
01:00:39,923 --> 01:00:42,117
I don't know whether to
thank you for rescuing me...

709
01:00:42,118 --> 01:00:44,746
or to kick your ass for
throwing me off a cliff.

710
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:47,664
Thank us or kick our ass, huh?

711
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,016
How about you tell us
where that device is?

712
01:00:54,039 --> 01:00:55,360
I mailed it to a friend.

713
01:00:55,812 --> 01:00:57,058
In Abu Dhabi.

714
01:00:57,417 --> 01:00:58,976
That was pretty easy.

715
01:00:59,678 --> 01:01:02,112
That other team would've
tortured you for that information.

716
01:01:02,113 --> 01:01:03,419
I didn't trust them.

717
01:01:04,407 --> 01:01:05,598
I trust you.

718
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:10,029
Now why would you trust
us? You barely know us.

719
01:01:10,173 --> 01:01:11,477
I know enough.

720
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:16,598
Ex-cop. Military,
something like that.

721
01:01:17,401 --> 01:01:19,408
The way you took out
those guys, serious training.

722
01:01:20,251 --> 01:01:23,670
Tech guy. Offended by the
hacker remark, naturally.

723
01:01:24,718 --> 01:01:25,718
Alpha.

724
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Mrs. Alpha.

725
01:01:30,157 --> 01:01:31,157
Joker.

726
01:01:31,181 --> 01:01:32,903
Wrong.

727
01:01:34,466 --> 01:01:35,647
Double Alpha.

728
01:01:36,205 --> 01:01:38,439
Man-candy. Y'know
what I'm saying?

729
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,031
Man, sit your candy-ass down.

730
01:01:42,479 --> 01:01:44,407
The disrespect is real around here.

731
01:01:44,518 --> 01:01:47,311
Life is binary. Zeroes and ones.

732
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:49,470
Only two things keep a
group like this together.

733
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:50,989
Fear or loyalty.

734
01:01:51,105 --> 01:01:53,616
And I don't see a drop
of fear among you guys.

735
01:01:53,724 --> 01:01:56,169
Very impressive.
Just one thing.

736
01:01:56,749 --> 01:01:58,071
They're not married.

737
01:01:58,145 --> 01:02:00,521
She's so off as crack,
you're just gonna roll with it?

738
01:02:00,637 --> 01:02:03,199
You're telling me there can't
be a double alpha in one group?

739
01:02:03,274 --> 01:02:04,499
You work for the US government?

740
01:02:06,409 --> 01:02:08,172
We got similar interests.

741
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,763
Tej, call it in.

742
01:02:14,596 --> 01:02:15,708
We're going to the Middle East!

743
01:02:37,162 --> 01:02:39,395
Hey, Dom, it was pretty
wild in that mountain, huh?

744
01:02:39,943 --> 01:02:41,427
That was too close.

745
01:02:42,195 --> 01:02:43,861
But we got the job done.

746
01:02:45,698 --> 01:02:47,818
Know what the crazy thing is? It's...

747
01:02:48,978 --> 01:02:50,452
You missed the bullets.

748
01:02:52,012 --> 01:02:53,651
That's messed up, huh?

749
01:02:53,761 --> 01:02:57,789
Brian, I've seen you jump
from trains, dive from planes.

750
01:02:58,439 --> 01:03:00,895
Hell, I saw your courage
the day I met you.

751
01:03:01,014 --> 01:03:02,014
Right.

752
01:03:02,569 --> 01:03:04,929
You wanna know the bravest
thing I've ever saw you do?

753
01:03:07,341 --> 01:03:08,710
Be a good man to Mía.

754
01:03:09,616 --> 01:03:12,563
Being a great father
to my nephew, Jack.

755
01:03:14,304 --> 01:03:15,865
Everyone's looking
for their thrill...

756
01:03:15,929 --> 01:03:17,198
but what's real,

757
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,836
is family.

758
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:21,751
Your family.

759
01:03:22,547 --> 01:03:24,275
Hold on to that, Brian.

760
01:03:32,398 --> 01:03:35,297
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

761
01:04:29,787 --> 01:04:32,193
This was hotter than
I thought it would be.

762
01:04:32,303 --> 01:04:34,804
Yeah, well, we are in the
desert so, it would be hot.

763
01:04:34,955 --> 01:04:36,686
No, I ain't talking
about the weather.

764
01:04:42,521 --> 01:04:43,627
My, my, my.

765
01:04:52,019 --> 01:04:55,079
Now that, is a woman that's worth
falling out a plane for.

766
01:04:55,912 --> 01:04:59,156
Get outta there, man. I got dibs on
that. You see me looking at that.

767
01:04:59,264 --> 01:05:00,341
Did you just say "dibs"?

768
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:01,771
What are you, in the fourth grade?

769
01:05:01,846 --> 01:05:03,320
Man, can you just get outta there?

770
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:04,557
It's a free market.

771
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:05,885
What are you talking about?

772
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:07,147
- Get outta that.
- Free.

773
01:05:07,182 --> 01:05:08,462
Rock, paper, scissors for it.

774
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:11,227
Are you guys for real right now?

775
01:05:11,327 --> 01:05:12,623
Look at you.

776
01:05:13,596 --> 01:05:16,382
You both look whooped
already. You got stalker eyes.

777
01:05:16,457 --> 01:05:19,762
I tried to call dibs
on Ramsey. Two years ago.

778
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,535
Her knee, my balls.

779
01:05:21,646 --> 01:05:23,776
Trust me, you don't wanna do that.

780
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:26,654
Hey! Ramsey!

781
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,670
Hello, Zafar.

782
01:05:32,332 --> 01:05:33,266
So you made some new friends.

783
01:05:33,413 --> 01:05:35,576
Yeah, some short-
tempered new friends.

784
01:05:35,646 --> 01:05:37,597
I need the speed drive
I sent you. Where is it?

785
01:05:37,709 --> 01:05:40,077
Oh good, you will be
pleased to know. I sold it.

786
01:05:40,952 --> 01:05:42,032
You sold it?

787
01:05:42,488 --> 01:05:43,488
You hear that?

788
01:05:43,512 --> 01:05:45,808
I asked you to take care of it.

789
01:05:45,917 --> 01:05:46,714
Why on Earth would you sell it?

790
01:05:46,821 --> 01:05:48,307
We're gonna need it back.

791
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,257
Impossible.

792
01:05:50,368 --> 01:05:53,688
Zafar, I stashed something
inside it. It's important.

793
01:05:53,798 --> 01:05:54,812
Okay.

794
01:05:54,925 --> 01:05:57,596
Good news: It is safe.

795
01:05:58,281 --> 01:05:59,648
And the bad news?

796
01:06:00,369 --> 01:06:01,591
It is very safe.

797
01:06:02,755 --> 01:06:05,369
Sold it to a Jordanian
prince living up there.

798
01:06:05,479 --> 01:06:06,932
Trust fund billionaire.

799
01:06:07,083 --> 01:06:08,771
Said he wanted it
in his supercar.

800
01:06:08,919 --> 01:06:10,687
Now see, this...

801
01:06:10,794 --> 01:06:13,750
This I like.
Billionaire, supercar.

802
01:06:13,863 --> 01:06:15,322
What makes it so, "súper"?

803
01:06:15,433 --> 01:06:18,139
242 mile per hour, top speed.

804
01:06:18,253 --> 01:06:20,490
And, it's bulletproof.

805
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,641
Am I the only one around right now?

806
01:06:25,749 --> 01:06:27,523
It's like, y'know what I'm sayin?

807
01:06:27,633 --> 01:06:28,633
.....

808
01:06:29,141 --> 01:06:30,141
Whatever.

809
01:06:30,171 --> 01:06:31,172
Where does he keep it?

810
01:06:32,962 --> 01:06:33,962
In his penthouse.

811
01:06:33,986 --> 01:06:35,107
Tower number one.

812
01:06:36,347 --> 01:06:38,778
Now why in the hell would he
keep his car in his penthouse?

813
01:06:38,885 --> 01:06:40,178
He's a billionaire, my friend.

814
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:41,940
He can do whatever he wants.

815
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,936
Now, tomorrow happens to be
the longest day of the year.

816
01:06:45,008 --> 01:06:48,416
Prince wants to celebrate it,
host a party, tomorrow afternoon.

817
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:50,002
So you can get us up there, right?

818
01:06:50,148 --> 01:06:50,823
Sure.

819
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:54,155
But not dressed like that.

820
01:07:23,868 --> 01:07:24,868
What?

821
01:07:25,178 --> 01:07:26,208
Something wrong?

822
01:07:26,791 --> 01:07:28,346
There's a billion things wrong.

823
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,385
But not in this moment.

824
01:07:32,325 --> 01:07:33,325
You look handsome.

825
01:07:34,055 --> 01:07:35,460
I feel awkward.

826
01:07:37,055 --> 01:07:38,352
You and me both.

827
01:07:39,357 --> 01:07:40,597
Seeing you dressed like this...

828
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:42,655
Just reminds me of something.

829
01:07:44,332 --> 01:07:45,332
Of what?

830
01:07:48,045 --> 01:07:49,382
Old times.

831
01:08:02,323 --> 01:08:03,323
You okay?

832
01:08:03,908 --> 01:08:05,353
Yeah, I'm fine .

833
01:08:06,989 --> 01:08:08,319
Showtime.

834
01:08:43,538 --> 01:08:44,670
No, listen, man.

835
01:08:44,785 --> 01:08:46,937
They're telling me they
party like this everyday,

836
01:08:47,051 --> 01:08:48,652
on this level, they party everyday.

837
01:08:48,735 --> 01:08:50,336
This is crazy. I might
have to move out here.

838
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:54,037
I think I'mma start a new
culture. It's called "Blarab".

839
01:08:54,148 --> 01:08:55,551
You know, like Black Arab?

840
01:08:55,625 --> 01:08:56,886
<i>How are we looking, Tej?</i>

841
01:08:56,997 --> 01:08:58,257
<i>We're almost in position.</i>

842
01:08:58,368 --> 01:08:59,625
Okay, so this is how we work this.

843
01:09:00,113 --> 01:09:02,299
<i>We gotta move in sync if we're
gonna pull this off so let's...</i>

844
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:05,654
<i>go over it to make sure everyone
clearly understands their role.</i>

845
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:07,209
Roman, that means you.

846
01:09:07,323 --> 01:09:09,714
You know what? You're being real
unprofessional right now, Tej.

847
01:09:09,833 --> 01:09:13,202
The God's Eye chip is hidden in a speed
drive installed in the prince's car...

848
01:09:13,272 --> 01:09:14,950
which he keeps in a safe room vault.

849
01:09:15,058 --> 01:09:17,503
Now I make 8 to 10
playing closed security.

850
01:09:17,615 --> 01:09:18,841
Not to mention the prince...

851
01:09:19,563 --> 01:09:22,042
and his personal bodyguards.

852
01:09:22,152 --> 01:09:23,778
Security cameras are
clustered by the north wall

853
01:09:23,877 --> 01:09:24,577
that's where the vault is.

854
01:09:24,687 --> 01:09:27,878
<i>Now to get in that vault, we gotta
tap into the security system...</i>

855
01:09:27,993 --> 01:09:29,454
<i>which can be accessed in
the prince's bedroom.</i>

856
01:09:29,534 --> 01:09:31,208
Alright, guys.
I'm going in.

857
01:09:33,867 --> 01:09:34,867
Excuse me.

858
01:09:34,891 --> 01:09:36,535
I was just looking for...

859
01:09:37,797 --> 01:09:39,595
- The party is that way.
- What?

860
01:09:39,705 --> 01:09:40,705
This room is off...

861
01:09:47,054 --> 01:09:48,054
Now once we're tapped in

862
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:50,428
Ramsey and I can hack into
the network and pop the door

863
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,122
so you can get in
and get that chip.

864
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:54,258
Wait, wait. You missed a step.

865
01:09:54,334 --> 01:09:56,381
What about my steps?
What am I supposed to be doing?

866
01:09:56,498 --> 01:09:57,757
No, we didn't miss anything.

867
01:09:57,831 --> 01:10:00,097
You're special team,
so when we need you...

868
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:01,496
do what you do best.

869
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:02,792
And that is?

870
01:10:03,778 --> 01:10:07,616
Shine brightly, like
only Roman Pearce can do.

871
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,596
Now we're talking.

872
01:10:10,711 --> 01:10:12,363
Alright, Tej. I'm in.

873
01:10:12,438 --> 01:10:14,605
Find a phone jack. The
tap always runs behind that.

874
01:10:14,718 --> 01:10:18,291
It's gonna be a 350
mega Hertz CAT5 D cable.

875
01:10:18,402 --> 01:10:19,943
They probably got a
couple dozen back there.

876
01:10:20,021 --> 01:10:22,213
But this'll be the bonded
pair with a plenum coat.

877
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:23,730
English, Tej.

878
01:10:23,843 --> 01:10:25,076
It'll be the orange wire.

879
01:10:27,741 --> 01:10:30,034
Alright, ladies and gentlemen,
we are in the pilot's seat.

880
01:10:34,405 --> 01:10:35,405
Alright, Roman.

881
01:10:36,205 --> 01:10:38,244
Do whatever it is you do.

882
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:40,160
It's your birthday, right?

883
01:10:40,877 --> 01:10:41,995
Are you Jasmine?

884
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:44,416
God, no. Not the birthday routine.

885
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:46,107
Happy birthday to you. This way.

886
01:10:46,183 --> 01:10:49,352
Excuse me, so sorry. I'm
coming through, sorry.

887
01:10:49,496 --> 01:10:50,496
Right this way.

888
01:10:50,558 --> 01:10:52,212
Listen, excuse me one second.

889
01:10:52,638 --> 01:10:54,431
Man, you ain't...

890
01:10:54,547 --> 01:10:56,493
Sir, thank you so much.

891
01:10:56,606 --> 01:10:59,087
Listen, people. Please
everybody, gather around.

892
01:10:59,205 --> 01:11:01,436
Understand something right now.
 
893
01:11:01,543 --> 01:11:03,350
Listen to what I'm telling y'all.

894
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:08,134
We are here to celebrate
Jasmine's 18th birthday.

895
01:11:08,246 --> 01:11:09,480
Happy birthday, my dear.

896
01:11:09,587 --> 01:11:14,232
Happy birthday to you.

897
01:11:15,608 --> 01:11:17,065
To you.

898
01:11:17,929 --> 01:11:19,490
To you.

899
01:11:20,204 --> 01:11:22,359
I wish I didn't see that.

900
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:28,134
Ramsey, open it up for us.

901
01:11:28,246 --> 01:11:29,247
Copy that.

902
01:11:29,357 --> 01:11:30,535
You're in.

903
01:11:45,047 --> 01:11:46,047
You realize what this is?

904
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:48,163
Lykan HyperSport.

905
01:11:48,283 --> 01:11:52,030
$3.4 million. 0 to 60
in less than 30 seconds.

906
01:11:52,132 --> 01:11:55,075
There's 7 of these things in the world
and this guy keeps it locked up in a vault.

907
01:11:55,183 --> 01:11:58,676
Nothing's sadder than
locking a beast in a cage.

908
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,953
Right now I really wanna
punch him in the face.

909
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:03,147
Okay.

910
01:12:04,624 --> 01:12:05,738
Let's get to work.

911
01:12:13,717 --> 01:12:14,717
You got this, right?

912
01:12:14,741 --> 01:12:15,741
Go.

913
01:12:16,604 --> 01:12:17,604
All right.

914
01:12:34,653 --> 01:12:37,158
Would you believe I knocked
him out with my charm?

915
01:12:37,785 --> 01:12:39,946
You ain't that charming, bitch.

916
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:47,519
Intruders.

917
01:12:47,635 --> 01:12:48,635
Lock it down.

918
01:12:50,365 --> 01:12:52,307
No!

919
01:12:52,502 --> 01:12:55,819
Tej, our magic trick is
failing. We're losing systems.

920
01:12:55,927 --> 01:12:56,927
I know.

921
01:12:57,810 --> 01:12:58,810
I see it.

922
01:12:58,857 --> 01:13:00,589
Tej, talk to me.

923
01:13:00,665 --> 01:13:02,859
I'm trying but their security
system is locking us out.

924
01:13:02,983 --> 01:13:04,840
Listen, ladies and gentlemen...

925
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:06,450
Oh, there he is.
These your dancers?

926
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,560
This is a party, baby!

927
01:13:12,193 --> 01:13:13,957
Some of ya'll probably
went to the bathroom

928
01:13:14,063 --> 01:13:16,477
and noticed that all the
hairspray was missing.

929
01:13:16,594 --> 01:13:18,653
Yep. She did it.

930
01:13:18,766 --> 01:13:20,306
Thank you.

931
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:28,543
And we're so happy
for you to be here.

932
01:13:28,657 --> 01:13:30,310
You look like you got some
missiles underneath that dress.

933
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:31,793
He did not just...

934
01:13:31,867 --> 01:13:33,107
Did you just say that?

935
01:13:44,951 --> 01:13:46,824
Shit! Not the gate!

936
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:50,575
Brian, faster!

937
01:13:51,246 --> 01:13:52,567
We're playing all the
defense we can up here.

938
01:13:52,638 --> 01:13:54,358
But we're gonna lose, you gotta hurry up.

939
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,889
Thank god, you showed up.

940
01:14:01,643 --> 01:14:03,374
These parties bore me to death.

941
01:14:55,963 --> 01:14:57,885
Guys get out of there right now.

942
01:14:57,992 --> 01:14:59,543
You've got an army headed your way.

943
01:14:59,618 --> 01:15:00,923
Brian, get up! Forget it!

944
01:15:03,523 --> 01:15:04,686
Tej, we're taking the car.

945
01:15:07,637 --> 01:15:10,593
This is what I do.
Y'know what I'm sayin'?

946
01:15:18,243 --> 01:15:20,413
Letty, Letty, talk to me.

947
01:15:20,487 --> 01:15:21,487
Are you okay?

948
01:15:22,453 --> 01:15:24,342
Guys I can't hold it.
I'm losing the final gate.

949
01:15:24,422 --> 01:15:25,422
You gotta get out of there.

950
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:27,375
Tear off the dash!

951
01:15:27,677 --> 01:15:28,677
Go through it.

952
01:15:33,797 --> 01:15:36,350
Wait, just hold on man.

953
01:15:48,422 --> 01:15:50,176
Time to unleash the beast.

954
01:16:11,863 --> 01:16:12,863
Go!

955
01:16:16,176 --> 01:16:17,456
Stay with me, I got you.

956
01:16:18,856 --> 01:16:19,856
Let's get the hell outta here.

957
01:17:00,075 --> 01:17:01,866
Dom. Cars don't fly!

958
01:17:03,382 --> 01:17:04,382
Cars don't fly!

959
01:17:05,665 --> 01:17:06,665
Shit!

960
01:17:35,616 --> 01:17:36,616
No brakes!

961
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,640
What?

962
01:17:38,046 --> 01:17:40,967
- No brakes!
- Shit!

963
01:17:55,638 --> 01:17:56,638
No!

964
01:18:36,257 --> 01:18:37,257
- Got it!
- Get out!

965
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,544
TORRES ETHIHAD Abu Dhabi

966
01:19:17,604 --> 01:19:19,167
Still miss the bullets, Brian?

967
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,982
There they are, disaster.

968
01:20:01,085 --> 01:20:01,634
I'm sorry.

969
01:20:01,772 --> 01:20:05,526
I get you an invite to the most
exclusive party in Abu Dhabi.

970
01:20:05,838 --> 01:20:06,501
Zafar.

971
01:20:06,611 --> 01:20:08,579
No, no, you steal the host's car.

972
01:20:09,356 --> 01:20:11,154
And you jump it between two buildings.

973
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:12,791
Actually, it was three buildings.

974
01:20:12,844 --> 01:20:16,585
Oh! Two, insult.
Three, honor. My bad

975
01:20:16,737 --> 01:20:17,737
Wow, wow, wow.

976
01:20:17,761 --> 01:20:19,249
I have to say...

977
01:20:19,572 --> 01:20:24,650
You've got an interesting interpretation
there of low key, Mr. Toretto.

978
01:20:25,413 --> 01:20:28,403
I thought we had an understanding.

979
01:20:29,331 --> 01:20:31,177
Sometimes you have to
play the hand you're dealt.

980
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:33,829
That's why I prefer
to be the dealer.

981
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:36,328
Good night.

982
01:20:42,425 --> 01:20:43,919
Kicked out of my own garage.

983
01:20:43,987 --> 01:20:44,987
This is great.

984
01:20:46,627 --> 01:20:47,993
May I?

985
01:20:49,276 --> 01:20:51,015
Brian.

986
01:20:51,992 --> 01:20:53,111
Give it to him.

987
01:21:10,384 --> 01:21:13,258
All that trouble for
this little.... thing.

988
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:16,306
With all due respect, Dom...

989
01:21:16,569 --> 01:21:19,416
You really did great work
back there. All of you.

990
01:21:20,003 --> 01:21:22,466
All of my men are now standing by...

991
01:21:22,467 --> 01:21:25,018
and are fully at your disposal.

992
01:21:30,077 --> 01:21:31,077
Your call.

993
01:21:33,273 --> 01:21:34,273
Ramsey.

994
01:21:37,743 --> 01:21:40,911
Fire it up, and find me Shaw.

995
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:47,904
Damn, this is crazy.

996
01:21:48,198 --> 01:21:49,711
Thank you.

997
01:21:51,065 --> 01:21:52,562
Give me a second.

998
01:21:56,856 --> 01:21:57,856
What is it doing now?

999
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,058
It's hunting.

1000
01:21:59,926 --> 01:22:02,535
Hacking into the security
cameras at Ethihad Towers.

1001
01:22:02,621 --> 01:22:04,736
That's the last place we saw
Shaw so that's where we start.

1002
01:22:06,909 --> 01:22:07,909
That's him, right there.

1003
01:22:09,138 --> 01:22:11,335
Wait. What are these
numbers out here for?

1004
01:22:11,402 --> 01:22:13,391
It's biomapping Shaw's face.

1005
01:22:17,214 --> 01:22:18,939
It will run that against every camera...

1006
01:22:21,028 --> 01:22:22,708
Every audio device in this hemisphere.

1007
01:22:35,394 --> 01:22:37,482
Bingo. Looks like he's holed up here.

1008
01:22:38,319 --> 01:22:39,319
That's perfect.

1009
01:22:39,343 --> 01:22:41,813
Automated factory, no
people. Lots of places to hide.

1010
01:22:41,921 --> 01:22:44,667
You just changed the
face of manhunts forever.

1011
01:22:46,221 --> 01:22:47,221
Congratulations.

1012
01:22:48,034 --> 01:22:50,728
Can I check my e-mail real quick?

1013
01:22:52,037 --> 01:22:53,537
Dawn's up in two hours.

1014
01:22:56,474 --> 01:22:58,138
We're gonna go take down Shaw then.

1015
01:22:59,083 --> 01:23:00,202
Go get changed.

1016
01:23:05,006 --> 01:23:06,395
We should go now.

1017
01:23:07,545 --> 01:23:09,670
Just you, your team and me.

1018
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:12,087
I thought you said at dawn?

1019
01:23:12,205 --> 01:23:13,205
My guys are racers.

1020
01:23:13,296 --> 01:23:14,742
Best drivers in the world.

1021
01:23:15,019 --> 01:23:16,597
But they ain't killers.

1022
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:17,733
Told you he'd say that.

1023
01:23:17,835 --> 01:23:20,389
I know you too well, Dom,
and I'm going with you.

1024
01:23:21,182 --> 01:23:23,770
Looks like we got a
nice little hunting party.

1025
01:23:24,118 --> 01:23:25,808
Let's go bag a shadow.

1026
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:36,222
Ten clicks out, boys. Get
ready to rock and roll.

1027
01:23:42,382 --> 01:23:43,899
Here we go. Weapons hot.

1028
01:24:06,142 --> 01:24:07,153
You ready for this?

1029
01:24:07,226 --> 01:24:08,226
Yeah.

1030
01:24:38,067 --> 01:24:40,015
I hope you're enjoying your last meal.

1031
01:24:47,301 --> 01:24:48,455
This is it?

1032
01:24:49,175 --> 01:24:50,217
This is all you want?

1033
01:24:51,047 --> 01:24:52,592
A dozen men?

1034
01:24:53,324 --> 01:24:55,372
I think you'll find
it's more than enough.

1035
01:25:09,601 --> 01:25:11,290
I'm ready to meet my maker.

1036
01:25:12,095 --> 01:25:13,095
Are you?

1037
01:25:13,364 --> 01:25:15,957
What were you expecting,
Toretto? Catch me off guard?

1038
01:25:17,219 --> 01:25:19,530
Me standing here,
waving a white flag?

1039
01:25:20,053 --> 01:25:21,421
Have you ever heard the saying:

1040
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:23,021
"The enemy of my enemy...

1041
01:25:23,135 --> 01:25:24,720
is my friend"?

1042
01:25:25,881 --> 01:25:27,176
I don't have friends.

1043
01:25:27,973 --> 01:25:29,197
I got family.

1044
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:33,054
Well, I got a lot of friends.

1045
01:25:47,013 --> 01:25:49,205
Keep your formation!
Sheppard, clear one!

1046
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:50,434
Brian, leave it!

1047
01:27:04,968 --> 01:27:05,968
Get down!

1048
01:27:17,805 --> 01:27:18,805
I got you.

1049
01:27:42,156 --> 01:27:43,345
The God's Eye.

1050
01:28:03,087 --> 01:28:06,003
You didn't really think I was
gonna walk in there naked, did you?

1051
01:28:08,242 --> 01:28:09,470
You got hit bad.

1052
01:28:10,156 --> 01:28:11,528
Look. Toretto.

1053
01:28:12,646 --> 01:28:14,373
I know you won't listen to me.

1054
01:28:15,062 --> 01:28:17,361
You're not gonna wanna
hear what I have to say.

1055
01:28:18,124 --> 01:28:19,526
But the truth is...

1056
01:28:20,215 --> 01:28:21,658
you really ought to...

1057
01:28:23,042 --> 01:28:24,660
try that Belgian ale, man.

1058
01:28:25,737 --> 01:28:26,930
It's something special.

1059
01:28:27,758 --> 01:28:28,878
Belgian ale, huh?

1060
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,890
We gotta get you to a hospital.

1061
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:34,970
No, you're not.

1062
01:28:35,208 --> 01:28:36,889
I carry my own health insurance.

1063
01:28:37,001 --> 01:28:42,590
SOCOM Medics on standby.
They're already inbound.

1064
01:28:44,214 --> 01:28:45,289
Pull over, kid.

1065
01:29:00,012 --> 01:29:02,149
Dom, you got to protect Ramsey.

1066
01:29:02,298 --> 01:29:03,847
As long as she's alive,

1067
01:29:05,408 --> 01:29:07,501
she can lock them out of
God's Eye and they know that.

1068
01:29:07,574 --> 01:29:10,389
That means, they're not gonna stop
coming until they've got her.

1069
01:29:11,229 --> 01:29:12,678
And this time when they come...

1070
01:29:12,790 --> 01:29:14,842
They're gonna come with
everything they've got.

1071
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:16,750
I'm not leaving you.

1072
01:29:16,862 --> 01:29:17,918
You're not.

1073
01:29:18,646 --> 01:29:19,867
I'm leaving you.

1074
01:29:23,048 --> 01:29:24,293
Go now, Dom.

1075
01:29:38,674 --> 01:29:41,388
A war is coming to us
whether we like it or not.

1076
01:29:42,509 --> 01:29:43,794
But if a war's coming...

1077
01:29:46,562 --> 01:29:48,726
We're gonna face them on
the streets we know best.

1078
01:29:54,585 --> 01:29:57,169
I'm all for winging it,
but this is crazy, man.

1079
01:29:57,687 --> 01:30:00,224
We got mercenaries with
some real heat on us.

1080
01:30:01,592 --> 01:30:03,046
I mean I ain't scared
of nothing but...

1081
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:04,642
..I don't even have a gun.

1082
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:06,967
Gun?

1083
01:30:09,181 --> 01:30:10,697
We got a whole city.

1084
01:30:10,809 --> 01:30:12,260
And we may have more than that.

1085
01:30:12,367 --> 01:30:13,556
If they use God's Eye...

1086
01:30:13,665 --> 01:30:15,866
it will tap the cameras
around to find our location.

1087
01:30:15,934 --> 01:30:17,809
Which means we could plant a virus.

1088
01:30:18,459 --> 01:30:20,116
And then break in when they access it.

1089
01:30:20,813 --> 01:30:23,255
So you're talking about
hacking my hacking device.

1090
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:24,455
That's brilliant.

1091
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:26,729
Yeah, but there's one problem.

1092
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:27,851
The signal strength.

1093
01:30:27,962 --> 01:30:31,319
We can't start a hack on them until 
they're within a two mile range.

1094
01:30:31,431 --> 01:30:33,122
- That's really close.
- Close?

1095
01:30:33,265 --> 01:30:34,464
These guys are military.

1096
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:37,270
If they're within two miles
of us, we already dead.

1097
01:30:37,379 --> 01:30:41,633
I don't know about y'all, but
I didn't really plan on dying today.

1098
01:30:41,745 --> 01:30:43,647
Only one way to stay alive.

1099
01:30:44,452 --> 01:30:46,325
We play keepaway with Ramsey.

1100
01:30:46,434 --> 01:30:47,154
What?

1101
01:30:47,268 --> 01:30:48,915
They can't hit us
if we keep moving.

1102
01:30:48,992 --> 01:30:50,224
And I'll take Shaw.

1103
01:30:50,755 --> 01:30:53,953
So basically we're just gearing up
for a big game of hot potato, huh?

1104
01:30:56,299 --> 01:30:58,651
Why does it feel like
I'm not gonna see you again?

1105
01:31:12,203 --> 01:31:13,640
I'll come back for that.

1106
01:31:15,398 --> 01:31:16,398
Promise?

1107
01:31:19,238 --> 01:31:20,238
Promise.

1108
01:31:40,249 --> 01:31:41,314
Brian, are you okay?

1109
01:31:41,436 --> 01:31:42,599
Mía, listen to me.

1110
01:31:43,184 --> 01:31:44,803
Something's about to go down.

1111
01:31:45,418 --> 01:31:47,539
If you don't hear
from me in 24 hours...

1112
01:31:50,141 --> 01:31:51,868
I need you to take Jack and move on.

1113
01:31:55,147 --> 01:31:56,147
You understand?

1114
01:31:58,046 --> 01:31:59,053
You understand what I'm saying?

1115
01:31:59,161 --> 01:32:00,894
No I can't do that, Brian.

1116
01:32:01,619 --> 01:32:02,619
No, I can't.

1117
01:32:04,438 --> 01:32:05,733
We're gonna have another baby.

1118
01:32:07,067 --> 01:32:08,181
It's a little girl.

1119
01:32:11,229 --> 01:32:12,871
And she's going to need her father.

1120
01:32:12,973 --> 01:32:15,044
So you have to finish
what you're doing...

1121
01:32:15,161 --> 01:32:16,522
and you have to come home to her.

1122
01:32:18,031 --> 01:32:19,491
You have to come home to us.

1123
01:32:21,209 --> 01:32:23,340
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

1124
01:32:23,859 --> 01:32:27,143
I was scared you'd be
disappointed with domestic life.

1125
01:32:29,583 --> 01:32:32,786
You know the best decision I ever
made was stepping into that store...

1126
01:32:34,355 --> 01:32:35,705
buying that first sandwich.

1127
01:32:38,233 --> 01:32:40,406
It was such a bad sándwich.

1128
01:32:41,177 --> 01:32:42,547
I know.

1129
01:32:42,695 --> 01:32:43,771
But I ate a lot of 'em.

1130
01:32:53,492 --> 01:32:54,492
I love you, Mía.

1131
01:32:57,930 --> 01:32:58,930
Don't do that.

1132
01:32:58,954 --> 01:32:59,954
What?

1133
01:33:00,568 --> 01:33:01,573
The way you said it.
It's like goodbye.

1134
01:33:01,695 --> 01:33:02,975
Say something else.

1135
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:06,738
Okay. Kiss Jack for me.

1136
01:33:09,513 --> 01:33:10,513
I will.

1137
01:33:17,251 --> 01:33:18,434
I love you, Brian.

1138
01:33:22,118 --> 01:33:23,453
I love you, Mía.

1139
01:33:55,106 --> 01:33:57,054
One last ride.

1140
01:35:04,802 --> 01:35:07,319
Boot up God's Eye, and find them.

1141
01:35:19,996 --> 01:35:20,996
-------

1142
01:35:21,626 --> 01:35:22,626
I'm getting something.

1143
01:35:25,982 --> 01:35:27,997
I got a positive ID. It's Toretto.

1144
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:32,189
God's Eye is placing
him at Hill and Seventh.

1145
01:35:35,845 --> 01:35:37,000
Should we follow him?

1146
01:35:37,184 --> 01:35:39,448
No. Let Shaw take care of him.

1147
01:35:39,558 --> 01:35:40,296
Find Ramsey.

1148
01:35:40,405 --> 01:35:41,470
Yes, sir.

1149
01:35:48,235 --> 01:35:50,257
I don't know why we gotta
keep driving around like this.

1150
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:51,927
Why can't we just
pull over somewhere...

1151
01:35:52,037 --> 01:35:54,881
park, gather our thoughts in
like a bunker somewhere?

1152
01:35:54,994 --> 01:35:56,797
Because it does not work like that.

1153
01:35:56,947 --> 01:35:59,067
We gotta stick close
enough to the bad guys...

1154
01:35:59,179 --> 01:36:01,156
in order to get in
range for Ramsey to hack 'em...

1155
01:36:01,268 --> 01:36:04,152
but we gotta be mobile enough not
to get shot like fish in a barrel.

1156
01:36:04,232 --> 01:36:06,712
So do me a favor, focus on the 
mission, keep us from getting killed.

1157
01:36:08,918 --> 01:36:10,393
Got them. Target acquired.

1158
01:36:10,470 --> 01:36:12,593
She's riding shotgun in a blue GT-R.

1159
01:36:20,955 --> 01:36:22,041
Guys, they're here.

1160
01:36:22,157 --> 01:36:23,413
How many cars?

1161
01:36:23,531 --> 01:36:24,254
None.

1162
01:36:24,367 --> 01:36:25,910
And that's kind of the problem.

1163
01:36:33,517 --> 01:36:34,871
Let's give them a tour.

1164
01:36:34,947 --> 01:36:36,142
Break on my mark.

1165
01:36:36,254 --> 01:36:38,349
Three, two, one.

1166
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:39,459
Go!

1167
01:36:43,418 --> 01:36:44,476
Splitting up won't work.

1168
01:36:44,892 --> 01:36:46,504
You can't hide from God's Eye.

1169
01:36:50,668 --> 01:36:51,668
In range.

1170
01:36:52,035 --> 01:36:53,180
<i>Ramsey, start the hack.</i>

1171
01:36:53,294 --> 01:36:54,684
Initiating.

1172
01:36:55,777 --> 01:36:56,777
Now.

1173
01:36:56,801 --> 01:36:57,801
-------

1174
01:36:58,968 --> 01:37:01,976
Sir, I think someone's
trying to hack the system.

1175
01:37:02,053 --> 01:37:03,205
It's Ramsey.

1176
01:37:03,318 --> 01:37:04,906
Send in the predator!

1177
01:37:05,001 --> 01:37:06,001
Take her out!

1178
01:37:06,025 --> 01:37:07,395
<i>Releasing predator.</i>

1179
01:37:39,344 --> 01:37:40,729
I think we lost the chopper.

1180
01:37:46,788 --> 01:37:48,514
I think we got bigger
problems than that!

1181
01:37:50,595 --> 01:37:51,867
Oh, my God.

1182
01:37:54,181 --> 01:37:55,581
What are you doing?

1183
01:37:55,694 --> 01:37:56,694
Going old school!

1184
01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:00,809
PUBLIC PARKING

1185
01:39:17,227 --> 01:39:18,227
-------

1186
01:39:18,251 --> 01:39:19,466
It's coming back around!

1187
01:39:32,405 --> 01:39:34,057
The predator's back on 'em.

1188
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:35,174
Ready missiles!

1189
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:36,250
Roger that.

1190
01:39:37,477 --> 01:39:38,477
Fire!

1191
01:39:39,802 --> 01:39:40,802
Shit!

1192
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:52,167
I need a lateral.

1193
01:39:52,277 --> 01:39:53,387
Rom, where are you?

1194
01:39:53,458 --> 01:39:55,084
Running back! Charging in.

1195
01:40:13,728 --> 01:40:15,050
Meet me on Third and Spring.

1196
01:40:15,127 --> 01:40:16,127
You got it!

1197
01:40:23,107 --> 01:40:24,185
I'm halfway there.

1198
01:40:24,266 --> 01:40:25,814
Grab your computer and
get in the window!

1199
01:40:25,889 --> 01:40:26,929
- Why?
- Do it, now!

1200
01:40:32,329 --> 01:40:33,553
You gotta go! Right now!

1201
01:40:38,204 --> 01:40:39,204
Fire!

1202
01:40:49,708 --> 01:40:50,708
No!

1203
01:40:57,386 --> 01:40:58,386
----

1204
01:41:08,468 --> 01:41:09,468
He made it!

1205
01:41:15,361 --> 01:41:17,036
Can't believe we pullled that off!

1206
01:41:18,626 --> 01:41:19,626
-----

1207
01:41:25,061 --> 01:41:26,297
Wait, we're still being hacked.

1208
01:41:26,411 --> 01:41:26,876
What?

1209
01:41:26,984 --> 01:41:28,503
God's Eye is still tracking Ramsey.

1210
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:30,151
Keep the drone in pursuit of her.

1211
01:41:30,259 --> 01:41:32,019
The signal has to be
coming from somewhere.

1212
01:42:12,046 --> 01:42:13,553
Breaking news out of Los Ángeles tonight.

1213
01:42:13,664 --> 01:42:16,978
In what can only be
described as vehicular warfare,

1214
01:42:17,054 --> 01:42:19,178
police are engaged
in a high speed pursuit...

1215
01:42:21,595 --> 01:42:25,093
I got it. The piggyback in the hack
off that satellite tower right there.

1216
01:42:25,238 --> 01:42:26,238
Take it out!

1217
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:38,836
Toretto.

1218
01:42:47,965 --> 01:42:50,338
Wait, what happened?
We were almost there.

1219
01:42:51,027 --> 01:42:52,652
They've cut the signal.
I can't finish the hack.

1220
01:42:52,755 --> 01:42:53,626
What do you mean?

1221
01:42:53,736 --> 01:42:54,736
------

1222
01:42:55,811 --> 01:42:57,292
Brian, they took out the tower!

1223
01:43:02,022 --> 01:43:04,111
Dad, what's going on?

1224
01:43:05,776 --> 01:43:07,317
Daddy's gotta go to work.

1225
01:43:25,222 --> 01:43:26,624
Alright, baby girl.

1226
01:43:26,732 --> 01:43:28,353
Elena's gonna be here in a little bit.

1227
01:43:28,378 --> 01:43:29,811
You know our drill.

1228
01:43:29,911 --> 01:43:31,230
Give me three for the road.

1229
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:51,763
You thought this was
gonna be a street fight?

1230
01:44:06,996 --> 01:44:08,580
You're goddamn right it is.

1231
01:44:53,765 --> 01:44:54,765
------

1232
01:44:54,822 --> 01:44:56,003
There has to be another way.

1233
01:44:56,117 --> 01:44:59,396
Wait. I'm seeing half a dozen cell
towers between Sixth and State.

1234
01:44:59,472 --> 01:45:02,178
Brian, if you can get to the top of
any one of those buildings around there...

1235
01:45:02,293 --> 01:45:04,946
we can reroute the signal
manually and finish the job.

1236
01:45:05,058 --> 01:45:06,058
I'm on it.

1237
01:45:09,165 --> 01:45:10,389
Sir, did you hear that?

1238
01:45:10,422 --> 01:45:12,253
O´Conner is on foot
heading for a repeater.

1239
01:45:12,362 --> 01:45:13,875
He's gonna try to reinitiate the hack.

1240
01:45:13,876 --> 01:45:15,552
Keep the drone on the girl.

1241
01:45:16,179 --> 01:45:17,211
Kiet.

1242
01:45:18,003 --> 01:45:20,160
<i>O´Conner's on foot somewhere
between Sixth and State.</i>

1243
01:45:20,234 --> 01:45:21,541
Don't let him make it there.

1244
01:45:36,863 --> 01:45:38,021
Boys is on us!

1245
01:45:38,143 --> 01:45:39,613
And them boys ain't ready for this!

1246
01:45:44,075 --> 01:45:45,207
Shit!

1247
01:46:04,046 --> 01:46:05,795
First a tank, then a plane...

1248
01:46:05,904 --> 01:46:07,492
Now we got a spaceship?

1249
01:46:07,610 --> 01:46:09,021
That's not a spaceship, that's a drone!

1250
01:46:09,133 --> 01:46:09,894
Oh it's a drone?

1251
01:46:10,005 --> 01:46:11,566
Now you gonna break it down
and be articulate...

1252
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:13,854
like you already know
what the hell is going on?

1253
01:46:13,935 --> 01:46:15,496
Shut your ass up and drive the car!

1254
01:46:22,192 --> 01:46:23,900
Letty, the football's on fire!

1255
01:46:23,981 --> 01:46:24,981
We need help!

1256
01:46:25,671 --> 01:46:26,978
Hang on! I'm coming!

1257
01:47:02,858 --> 01:47:04,656
Ramsey, get ready to go again.

1258
01:47:07,241 --> 01:47:08,553
Drone has missile lock.

1259
01:47:08,669 --> 01:47:09,669
Fire!

1260
01:47:19,582 --> 01:47:20,582
Target destroyed.

1261
01:47:26,130 --> 01:47:28,055
Wait! God's Eye still has her.

1262
01:47:28,202 --> 01:47:29,202
How can that be?

1263
01:47:42,468 --> 01:47:45,570
Get up. Come on.

1264
01:47:46,403 --> 01:47:47,403
Let's go! Let's go.

1265
01:47:51,252 --> 01:47:52,692
They switched her under the bridge.

1266
01:47:53,128 --> 01:47:54,128
What?

1267
01:47:56,601 --> 01:47:58,889
You gotta get outta here, it's on
your trail and it's coming fast.

1268
01:47:59,007 --> 01:47:59,649
Got it.

1269
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:02,461
So if this car goes south,
who's coming to save us?

1270
01:48:02,883 --> 01:48:05,435
Save us, honey? We're it.

1271
01:48:05,507 --> 01:48:06,216
Where are they now?

1272
01:48:06,306 --> 01:48:07,957
Six blocks east, hauling ass.

1273
01:48:08,998 --> 01:48:10,481
Where we heading, Tej?

1274
01:48:10,629 --> 01:48:12,830
There's a service elevator
past the maintenance center.

1275
01:48:12,908 --> 01:48:14,691
It will take you directly
up to the repeater.

1276
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,198
Brian, you gotta hurry!

1277
01:50:17,163 --> 01:50:18,522
Too slow!

1278
01:50:33,568 --> 01:50:34,692
It's coming back.

1279
01:50:34,813 --> 01:50:35,897
We'll lose them in the tunnel.

1280
01:50:36,821 --> 01:50:37,821
Got it!

1281
01:50:37,845 --> 01:50:38,845
Fire!

1282
01:50:55,770 --> 01:50:56,930
I can't shake this thing!

1283
01:51:00,051 -->  01:51:01,536
The predator has missile lock.

1284
01:51:01,973 --> 01:51:02,973
Take it out!

1285
01:51:29,711 --> 01:51:30,711
No way.

1286
01:51:41,972 --> 01:51:44,014
Wait! What happened?

1287
01:51:44,121 --> 01:51:46,357
Sir, someone just
double tapped our drone.

1288
01:51:46,517 --> 01:51:47,517
What?

1289
01:51:48,725 --> 01:51:51,313
Hey, did you bring the cavalry?

1290
01:51:51,631 --> 01:51:54,207
Woman, I am the cavalry.

1291
01:51:57,642 --> 01:51:58,972
Who is that?

1292
01:52:02,013 --> 01:52:03,130
That's Hobbs!

1293
01:52:12,217 --> 01:52:13,219
I'm at the repeater.

1294
01:52:13,339 --> 01:52:14,835
The access cable's in the base.

1295
01:52:14,943 --> 01:52:17,850
Just plug it into your phone
and Ramsey will be back online.

1296
01:52:19,579 --> 01:52:20,716
Ramsey, go!

1297
01:52:24,871 --> 01:52:27,324
Brian did it. We're back in.

1298
01:52:29,709 --> 01:52:31,254
<i></i>

1299
01:52:31,526 --> 01:52:33,102
We've got God's Eye back.

1300
01:52:40,801 --> 01:52:42,773
- We lost the God's Eye!
- What?

1301
01:52:43,102 --> 01:52:44,102
Shit!

1302
01:52:48,568 --> 01:52:50,881
Military's inbound.
Three minutes and closing.

1303
01:52:50,947 --> 01:52:52,039
We need to get
the hell outta here.

1304
01:52:54,383 --> 01:52:56,676
Tej, Roman, I'm on my way.

1305
01:52:56,791 --> 01:52:58,369
Alright, homie. I'll see you there.

1306
01:53:45,553 --> 01:53:46,986
I have eyes on Toretto.

1307
01:54:07,552 --> 01:54:08,745
Shaw's in the way.

1308
01:54:08,858 --> 01:54:11,143
Then it seems our
friendship is at an end.

1309
01:54:11,725 --> 01:54:13,021
Do it.

1310
01:54:28,346 --> 01:54:30,026
The thing about street fights?

1311
01:54:32,801 --> 01:54:34,756
The street always wins.

1312

Goodbye, Toretto.

C'mon, buddy.

Is he breathing?

1326
01:58:30,134 --> 01:58:32,047
Here's what I need you to do.
Keep his head tilted up.

1327
01:58:32,117 --> 01:58:33,708
All right. Keep
it back like this.

1328
01:58:34,101 --> 01:58:36,657
Clinch his nose, keep his head
tilted. Breathe in him now. Go.

1329
01:58:37,035 --> 01:58:38,035
That's good.

1330
01:58:38,059 --> 01:58:38,883
Come on, Dom.

C'mon, dammit. Let's go. Come

1335
01:58:48,299 --> 01:58:50,116
Come on, Dom. Come back, c'mon.

1336
01:58:50,224 --> 01:58:51,884
Come on, buddy. Dom, come on!

1337
01:58:51,991 --> 01:58:53,283
Back off!

1338
01:58:53,393 --> 01:58:55,413
Will you stop? Breathe into him.

1339
01:58:55,487 --> 01:58:56,938
You breathe into him.

1340

- You breathe into him.

But I want you to listen.

Stay awake and focus on me.

I remember everything.

1347
01:59:22,741 --> 01:59:24,218
It came to me like a flood.

1348
01:59:27,181 --> 01:59:29,587
That night, in the
Dominican Republic.

1349

You will never be alone again.

1356
01:59:56,258 --> 01:59:59,101
I vow, wherever you go, I go.

01:59:59,254 --> 02:00:00,293
You ride, I ride.

1358

You fight, I fight.

1359
02:00:02,779 --> 02:00:04,937
And if you ever die on me,
Dominic Toretto...

1360
02:00:05,050 --> 02:00:06,818
I'm gonna die with you.

It's about time.

Oh, God.

1370

Why didn't you tell
me we were married?

1371
02:01:04,127 --> 02:01:06,661
Because you can't tell
someone they love you.

1372
02:01:17,290 --> 02:01:18,671

Well I want you to dig through 38
