I didn't even have to put ketchup on it.

See, I'm not a total gaijin.

I thought you were born here.

00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,677
Well, "outsider" can mean many different things.

484
00:59:19,974 --> 00:59:22,017
My mom died when I was 10.

485
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:26,855
She came out here from Australia
when she finished high school.

486
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:31,068
And all I know about her is
that she went to work in a hostess bar.

00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:36,323
DK's grandmother took me in.

488
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:42,371
Well, my parents split up when I was three.

489
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:47,251
Me and Mom moved around a lot.
Mostly 'cause of me.

490
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,255
Well, it was all 'cause of me.

491
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:55,676
Kind of made myself an outsider, you know,

492
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:58,178
without even thinking about it.

493
01:00:00,306 --> 01:00:04,310
But I realize now, outsider or insider,
it doesn't really matter.

494
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:08,188
All that matters is knowing what you really want

495
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:10,899
and going after it.

496
01:00:31,045 --> 01:00:33,839
We used to come up here when we were kids.

497
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:37,635
Even before we could drive we'd cut class, sneak out,

498
01:00:37,718 --> 01:00:40,262
come up here, and watch the older kids drift.

499
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:49,021
Things were different back then.

500
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:55,903
Once I got my license, I practically lived up here.

501
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:59,073
Back then, kids just drove whatever they had.

502
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:01,909
You know, we just made do.
No one bothered us.

503
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:07,414
The day I got my license
is the day I got my first speeding ticket.

504
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:09,917
The day after that, I won my first race.

505
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:12,961
I beat this rich kid by three lengths.

506
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:16,715
I gotta admit, it felt good.

507

No, it's cool. Look, I'll figure it out.

623
01:21:03,845 --> 01:21:07,140
I'd like to see Mr. Kamata, please.

624
01:21:40,048 --> 01:21:41,132
Sean.

625
01:21:45,887 --> 01:21:47,555
You need to leave.

626
01:21:47,889 --> 01:21:50,016
You came to the wrong place.

627
01:21:50,183 --> 01:21:52,394
I didn't come here to see you.

628

Takashi.

629
01:21:54,896 --> 01:21:56,606
Who's your friend?

630
01:21:58,233 --> 01:21:59,234
Nobody.

631
01:22:00,276 --> 01:22:01,694
I can handle this.

632
01:22:02,487 --> 01:22:05,782
I have something which belongs to you, sir.

633
01:22:22,674 --> 01:22:23,925
You think

634
01:22:25,009 --> 01:22:29,556
you can walk in here, dump some cash and walk out?

635
01:22:31,683 --> 01:22:35,728
I know I'm only returning what belonged
to you in the first place, sir.

636
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:39,441
But that's not why I really came.

637
01:22:40,108 --> 01:22:42,110
I came here to apologize.

638
01:22:44,362 --> 01:22:47,991
I know your nephew and I have embarrassed ourselves badly.

639
01:22:48,116 --> 01:22:50,118
Don't listen to this gaijin.

640
01:22:51,453 --> 01:22:52,495
Takashi...

641
01:22:53,997 --> 01:22:56,875
after everything you've done, you're giving me orders?

642
01:22:56,958 --> 01:22:58,126
I apologize.

643
01:22:59,961 --> 01:23:03,756
Sir, I'm here to offer you a peaceful solution.

644
01:23:06,384 --> 01:23:08,845
How do you plan to accomplish that?

645
01:23:10,305 --> 01:23:11,473
A race.

DK and I have caused nothing but problems for you, for us.

648
01:23:22,567 --> 01:23:26,529
And I'm asking you to allow us to settle this,
once and for all.

649
01:23:28,364 --> 01:23:29,574
We race

650
01:23:31,326 --> 01:23:33,411
and the loser leaves town for good.

651
01:23:33,495 --> 01:23:36,331

Good.

653
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:41,002
Then it should be easy.

654
01:24:19,541 --> 01:24:21,668
The cops took all the cars.

Hey!

That's why she's spitting.

657

We almost there, Twink.
Couple more tweaks.

658
01:26:09,734 --> 01:26:12,111
It's not the car I'm worried about, man.

659
01:26:13,488 --> 01:26:16,991
DK picked this road for a reason.
This is his mountain.

660
01:26:19,494 --> 01:26:22,622
He's the only one to ever make it to the bottom.
